You know what I do is to write for kids, and in fact, I probably am the author for children, more read in the United States.
And I always say people who don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> as a <unk> or with <unk> <unk> and nobody has been chosen a farmer.
Today, I'm here to talk about circles and <unk>
And you know that a <unk> usually is something that you fell in somewhere else.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle of which I'm going to talk.
My circle started in the years ago in the middle school in the middle of the last school in <unk> where I was the rare of the class.
When I put up to death, every week in the bathroom of kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life to let me go into the bathroom of the room.
I did it in <unk>
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a <unk> -- and in the '60s, I felt the need to start working in organizations who were fighting to AIDS.
About three or four years, half of the night I received a telephone phone called the <unk> <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that we have never got to know about.
You could be <unk> and please brings that man that you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have cancer <unk> and I would like you to do it with this for it?
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We were going to see, we <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We find out a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and it was <unk>
It's something we knew how to do.
And so as the woman I wanted to <unk> as a adult came to <unk> it became a box of <unk> and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, had become a circle -- and that <unk> that I would have been done in itself.
The <unk> is that death is part of life.
So she saved my life, my partner and I was able to save it.
And you know that part of life needs all the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I was talking about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and which is all connected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica over 10 years, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what I was in front of me.
The <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> and I couldn't think that it was about a <unk> <unk> over other year after a year.
The <unk> were born when you get in the glaciers or the barriers of ice.
Every region has its own individual word.
They have a different way to interact with their environment, and their experiences.
Some of them are forced to <unk> and they hold up to the end, while others can't be <unk> more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, to see a <unk> which are isolated and alone, in a lot of as we look at us sometimes like humans.
But the truth is all the opposite.
As you become a <unk> I'm <unk> his atmosphere <unk>
As it comes into a region called <unk> water <unk> which feeds a lot of ways of life.
I'm going to visit me these <unk> as if you try to remember the portraits of my ancestors -- knowing that in these unique moments there are in that way and they're not going to exist in that way.
It's not the death when it was <unk> it's not a end, but a single way of his way in the cycle of life.
And part of the ice of the <unk> that I think is very <unk> it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has more than 100 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you are from a <unk> I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's just a little bit right, I'll get to see a <unk>
Here they have.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like to have to have to get attention to the way of the iceberg and their <unk>
You can see here, starts to <unk> the ship has moved into the other side and the man is there.
This is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the browser shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, each <unk> a baby.
So, two couples each of a baby.
I don't want you to be <unk> too much in the details of <unk> because if you stop to think about the truth, I don't pay attention.
Let's think about a moment.
And in this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is sent to the <unk>
And, in the other case, the X chromosome is sent to the <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
I'll come to talk about them later.
In my motor activity to play two <unk>
In one of my <unk> work with the history of trustworthiness.
I am a <unk> for training and what I study in this case is the way people are <unk> the anatomy -- -- of human bodies and <unk> how the body -- the idea of the <unk> what have thought about the body.
The other role that matters in my work is a <unk> like <unk> of patients or, like I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are doctors.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenge social challenges.
I've been working on, for example, with <unk> two people within a same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people a lot more low than a half.
And I've worked with many cases of people with sex <unk> individuals whose physics physics doesn't fit in the male <unk> and <unk>
In modern lines we can <unk> <unk>
The <unk> takes a lot of ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have a sex to have a sex that are not going to be <unk> in the real ways or <unk>
For instance, it's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose gene gene <unk> and he says the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life, which is <unk>
And then, in life <unk> the <unk> produce cooperation.
But because this individual is not <unk> the body is not <unk>
It's <unk> <unk>
So, there are high <unk> but no reaction.
As a result, the body has been following a course of <unk>
When you look at the baby it has kind of a girl.
It's a kid -- a little girl.
And, often, it's not because it is growing and developing the environment, but it doesn't have the period of it, when somebody realizes that something is going on.
And then after you ask them, they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> it actually has <unk> and a chromosome <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think about a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women like men, we have in the body something called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> <unk> produce <unk> <unk>
Most women like me, I think a <unk> woman doesn't know their structure -- I think to be a typical woman most of women like me, are sensitive to the <unk>
We create <unk> and respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, somebody like me, has the brain of the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> which has <unk> <unk>
So sex is something complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way you can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I received a <unk> <unk> <unk> and raised as <unk> I had married and sexual relationships with it, I had a life like a kid and I had just just found that I had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known like <unk> <unk> <unk>
And he had the 20th century and in the goal, the <unk> <unk> were so active that in essence, made a green environment, the sharks.
As a consequence, their <unk> were exposed to the component of the component of the component of the component of the component of the component of the component of the component of the component of the component of the component of the component Prize.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was at 19 years ago when he started to have doctors went through the <unk> <unk> when doctors discovered that in fact, was woman on it.
Well, another example of a <unk> case.
Some people with chromosomes -- develop what is known as <unk> is that you have tissue <unk> in tissue <unk>
We don't know how to do that.
So, there's a lot of sex.
The reason that kids with this kind of bodies are going to be <unk> identical <unk> or <unk> to surgery -- <unk> is not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
In many cases people are perfectly <unk>
The reason that you get to several surgeries is that they're a threat for our social categories.
The system is based in the idea that a particular press, brings up a particular identity,
We have the idea that being woman is to have identity, <unk> <unk> to be black wants to be <unk> in terms of it?
So a very strange idea.
And when you give us a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with the <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture of <unk>
Our nation is based on a <unk> concept.
Imagine the amazing thing that is going to have kids who were born as two people within a same body.
The largest recent case is last year in the last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called <unk> "What do you test to be able to do to determine whether <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is not such a <unk>
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't adapt a <unk> line between men and women or women and <unk> we are us who are facing that line.
So what we have is a situation, where the more comes to science, more we need to admit that these categories -- we thought they were <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> directly with <unk> <unk> <unk> are much more than <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of development, something that it turns up much more complicated than the <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk>
<unk> for instance, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with the disease.
What do you think about the fact of <unk> in just a few <unk>
And as we <unk> in the science we get increasingly in a remote area where we have to recognize that the <unk> <unk> which is probably too much <unk>
And we're looking at this in all the origins of human life.
One of them, for example, in our culture today, in the United States in the United States in the United States of today, are the struggles to the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to get a moment from which a body gets human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are discussions very <unk> today in day <unk> not in public -- but I know within the <unk> about when somebody has been dead.
Our ancestors never had to be <unk> with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of it would put a <unk> in front of the nose and if it was not <unk>
If you stop the <unk>
But today, we can, for instance, extract a critical organs in a body and put them into another body.
And, as a result, we have to deal with the dilemma of that really really <unk> and this puts us in a hard situation, that we don't have the simple samples of the past.
And you might think that this explosion suddenly could be <unk> to somebody like me.
In politics I'm <unk> <unk> to the people with healthy bodies but I have to admit that it gets <unk>
<unk> that these categories are much more powerful than we thought about me.
<unk> from the point of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I'm a <unk> <unk> of <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so safe, and so radical and so radical in what they did, I find each of that musical <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
It's why happened in <unk> with <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> for me, the first activists of the anatomy and tell you why.
What they do was a <unk> concept and <unk> with another thing that was radical and beautiful and it kept for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what our <unk> <unk> was the idea of the <unk> The intensity was based on a very simplistic concept of coordination.
The rest of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of <unk>
They had the concept of blue.
They were from the idea of the idea that it was going to be the political power of the sun and then the son, etc.
<unk> <unk> <unk> that idea and the <unk> for a new concept -- and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the computer field and decided that the anatomy that matters was the anatomy in common and not the differences -- that was a very radical thing.
And in part of it they were doing because they put part of a <unk> system, where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time to get the science.
And there are very clear, if you look at the story of <unk> <unk> that many were really interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to <unk> it is a <unk> <unk>
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look for instance, the Declaration of <unk> talk about nature, and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a consequence of us the idea of the coincidence of the coincidence <unk>
And, when we do that, they were <unk> the basis of the future Rights movement.
They didn't think of that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened?
And women <unk>
Then he came up the success of the movement, the rights of the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the board of the Rights movement, and saying, "I'm a <unk>
Again, people are <unk> to the coincidence <unk> on the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk>
The problem is, of course, that as we look at it, we have to start ask to ask why they keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give a fish to a human rights than a human being.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> in order to exist?
I don't want to say that at five years, they had to allow them to have sex relationships or <unk>
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me have sense and I think we should <unk>
But the challenge is trying to figure out what they are, why do they keep it.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> <unk>
We have two <unk> both <unk> to the same day.
Let's imagine one of them, <unk> was born three months before time: the one of June of 1980.
<unk> for the contrary, it was born in engineering, was born.
For the only fact I've been born three months before Mary <unk> all the rights three months before to Henry -- the right of the <unk> the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that because it has an biological age, but because it was born later.
We find other <unk> in relation to their rights.
<unk> in virtue of being considered a man -- if I don't say if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered to be known now is <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
They don't have the same rights of marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So we were still <unk> <unk> <unk> that in several aspects are <unk> and critical.
And now the question is, what do we do now that the science is so much in the field of the anatomy that we have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we start?
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of beautiful attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line in some part, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people have caught in a strange position position.
For example: Texas at a certain point has decided to marry a man -- no thing to have chromosome and and that to marry a woman has to have yesterday.
Now in the practice they don't make care of people people.
But this is also very strange to give the story that I told to the beginning of <unk> <unk>
If you look at one of the American parents of modern democracy Dr. Martin Luther King in his speech <unk> <unk> <unk> a solution.
It says that we should be able to judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond the assumptions.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea seems to me.
But in practice, how do you do?
How can people judge people in the contents of their <unk>
I want to point -- I also am not sure that we had <unk> in this to <unk> rights to people, because I admit that I know about some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more of the social services that I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more smart decisions and <unk> on their sex relationships that I know.
So, how do we put the subject to the subject of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And a part of me ask what would happen if the character of one person could be measured with a instrument, maybe with a <unk>
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important to be very important that the United States will continue to become this thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good work in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good work in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the person that a man who would feel <unk> by other men is <unk> unless you're willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be able to be able to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the one that I spoke a couple of years ago that I had done a couple of years ago that had done to light <unk> for then and then we put out their name.
But when the phone asked her, the reason of the operation, was a very <unk> operation, I came up to me that in that other country would be very <unk> and so I had to do it.
So I said, "Well, has considered the political fear of the <unk>
America offers huge possibilities to the people to be who they are without <unk> to change for the good of the state.
So I think we have to be the head.
Well, to end -- I mean I've been talking about the <unk>
And I want to think about the democracy, or as I could have been, if we had given more participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical <unk> and it is that I think you can have different ideas from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking in group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in doing a sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in the differences between men and women in terms of how to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about studies -- is that women in average, -- not all -- but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to social relationships.
And, if we think about that, we have a interesting situation, in our hands.
A few years ago, when I was in the school, one of my <unk> who knew I was interested in <unk> <unk> I had <unk> me like <unk> I did a <unk> <unk>
<unk> what has <unk> <unk>
And I thought, "This is the most stupid question that I've heard about.
Poetry has to see with the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing <unk> in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about their question, more has something to be <unk> in the <unk>
I mean, I could have something different between the brain brain, and the male that makes us more <unk> to social relationships and willing to help the more vulnerable.
So if they were all very important to find the way to protect the people in the part of the state, it is possible to be able to get more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have to build the concept of protection with <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when you get the democracy beyond the <unk> to think less in the individual body in terms of identity, and to think more in relationships.
So, while we try to create a more perfect <unk> let's think about what we do about each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided we had to generalize how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where you want to go to live and work, and to work, have the possibility to choose between least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
Well, at this moment we're far from that goal.
There are thousands of millions of people in developing countries that don't count with a single city to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that we're worth a lot more than their construction cost.
So easily could we be <unk> to the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this can sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But just <unk> by <unk>
Imagine the half of the ones who would want to live in apartments and that to the other half of it still <unk> to do it.
They could try to increase the capacity to make it <unk> in all of the basic bodies.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that are all the ones and the areas that are around the world, and the <unk>
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a entirely new place to build a new apartments building a whole new new building and when the rules of that place is <unk> building <unk>
So I proposed that governments are <unk> new <unk> enough to contain cities, and I gave them a name, cities under <unk>
Later to me found that more or less time at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of general.
Did you know that every year about 75 <unk> <unk> of his country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask the United States, and they wanted to ask them to ensure that those people could stay and do those same things in Amsterdam.
In the summer of the summer of the summer of the summer, <unk> country by a <unk> crisis.
In the next elections <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which it would be <unk> and at the same time.
He asked it to <unk> that was his boss of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give you a talk about <unk>
Through a process of <unk> essay and a huge amount of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of the rules, like those rules that say that you can't go and jumped to all the current residents of apartments.
<unk> a lot of attention to new technologies -- but it needs to be so much of technologies as a norms of norms for <unk> and usually the rules that they get to us.
In the night of 2010, a friend. He sent to <unk> a link to <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They got to me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in <unk> in a <unk> room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable that are cities, much more valuable than its cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of the country in a place like New York.
But it was a pretty abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a <unk> <unk> he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was in terms of very simple that a city in <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that you can choose if you want to go or not to live under those rules.
So the president of <unk> and he said that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way to be the way that our country comes on.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about new four and five of January.
So I introduced another talk about data, which included a picture like this, that I was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very large.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
It's just this airport, it takes more than 100 miles old.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> of that to build a new town, you have to start with a site that would measure for least 1,000 miles old.
That's more than 100 <unk>
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The faces of the public were very serious and <unk>
The leader of the Congress came back to the platform and said, "Mama, <unk> so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have here in my <unk>
So I felt and showed the <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> that a new city can provide new options for people.
There would be a choice of a city that could go to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles into the North.
And also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would have to be able to be able to be able to be able to benefit in the countries associated to establish and make the rules of the <unk> so that they could all trust that the <unk> actually <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It could be easily a few thousand miles old.
And just after the age of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their <unk> and adding a <unk> that would be able to create these special regions of development.
In a country that I had just going to go through this <unk> crisis in Congress to favor this <unk> <unk>
They all are all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
By <unk> in the <unk> you have to do two times in Congress.
The 17 of February became another time in another <unk> <unk>
And then after the <unk> of 21 at 24 of February, a few of 30 <unk> was the two places in the world that are more interested in participate in the building of cities.
One of them is South <unk>
This is a picture of a new new center in the city which is building in North <unk> is bigger than the center of Boston.
All that you see there was built in four years, after it was four years ago to get the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a <unk>
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and you're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> and the time would allow you to operate under a legal system.
A country has already committed to allow his Supreme Court is the last of the last degree for this new <unk> system.
There are <unk> and of cities that are really interested in the project.
They can even get something of <unk>
But the only thing we know that you've already seen, is that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies who would want to be in <unk> especially in a place with a <unk> area and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say I'd like to change the other place.
There are a million a year that comes from Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to go back to his family to go back to their family to go to get a job, sometimes they have to win the money for so just eating or buy them.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids who are trying to try with their parents who don't have seen, in some cases, in a decade at a decade at a decade at a decade at a decade at a decade at a decade at a decade at a decade at a decade at a decade at a decade at a decade at a decade at a decade at a decade at a decade
So, what does you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or to build a dozen these or a hundred of these around the world?
What do you think about <unk> so the families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I asked me to say, thank you.
I am <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to do a public <unk> and it's living with <unk>
I love to find, <unk> and more recently, I was going to go in my blog <unk> <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> and <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The second of the second hand allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I am going to meet people <unk> by the general of my money is going to be a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buy it in my <unk> <unk>
I mean, what I'm going to do today?
It will be from my schools?
I love the <unk>
It cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are <unk> then I feel that I've won.
I'll go back to the subject of my <unk> I want to tell you what you would do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone to have all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I mean.
I've brought seven pairs of <unk> and nothing else.
<unk> interior for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that it would be able to find everything else I would like to use after you get here to <unk>
And because I don't know like the woman who walk at TED <unk>   That means that I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the mark for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
When I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that I think or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new <unk>
Let's start with 2006.
So this would call this <unk> <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see well.
You can even see it for less than 50 dollars.
All the world, including the <unk> and it was the most expensive I've used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you have a red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not only <unk> it would be <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the kid who take inside it.
Sometimes people say that it seems to play to the <unk> or I remember his little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key one.
If you think you do a good thing with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't see a good thing with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain to explain in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, there is no look like you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for no one of this audience.
We have to be able to do everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal universal truth for you, <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a very great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I tried this one and again when people were approaching this week just for what I was doing, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously all of this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to push everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to go back to certain things.
I don't need to be wondering about these things, because the back of the corner, always have another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a factor of your brain that we can divide in two sides.
The left side, which is the <unk> and the right side of the right side is the part of it.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a <unk> of our brain.
For instance, this would be somebody that is completely <unk>
This would be somebody that is totally <unk>
So, Where do you do with your brain in this one.
Some <unk> for one of the top, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something -- with a big <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not the other <unk>
You can be logical and <unk>
I think about one of those people, which just like most of the other quantum physicists -- we need pretty powerful to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need very intuition to do that experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put it with them and then we see as <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
A intuition that you can have developed with the step of the years is the ones that says that one thing can be only in a place at the time.
I mean, it can sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you were not born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a <unk>
It was a little kid and I didn't do it very well, they always have <unk>
But I bet the playing with that <unk> <unk> he taught a lot of valuable lesson and is that the big things don't allow the <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that can have in the world, except they be a <unk>
It would be a terrible model for a physical model -- because they don't play with white bars play with these weird particles.
And when they play with their particles, discover that they do all sorts of weird things -- as you can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these <unk> and they called the theory of quantum mechanics.
In the point of that point was the physics of a few years ago, you needed from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But they didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That is not very good to me, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it doesn't be very well to my <unk>
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it should not all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it didn't have to be.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could somehow show that a common object also is also the principles of quantum mechanics.
It's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a quantum mechanics.
So what we see here is a small chip program.
And you can try to see the green dot in the middle.
That's the little metal with what I'm going to talk about a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here's what I'm going to expand a little bit of the center.
And then here we do is a good good thing to the small <unk>
So what we see is a little bit of <unk> with a form of liberties and that comes into a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would have a computer.
I went to a clean room with a chip again, and I started to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this with a <unk> form of <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the capacity to be in a quantum situation, but for it needs a little bit of help.
Let me do an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is in a elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am in a elevator -- I do all sorts of creative things -- but then when another people will go out to do those things -- because I don't want to do that things -- because I don't want to do, or actually <unk>
The quantum mechanics says that the objects are behave in the same way.
The classmates of the <unk> objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> and the wind on the room.
And so we knew that if we wanted this little metal with the quantum mechanics, we would have to go to quantum mechanics.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights -- then <unk> a <unk> and then we put it all the air and then it would take it into a temperature of less than a degree for zero at all.
Now, to be just in the <unk> the little metal piece of metal is free to be <unk>
So we measure their movements.
We discovered that it became very strange.
Instead of stay perfectly paralyzed and the way it was <unk> and the way it was <unk> it was like a breath of this way -- like a <unk> which goes and <unk>
And to give you a <unk> <unk> we were able to do that <unk> and that we didn't have to be <unk> at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm going to tell you about is a really fantastic.
What does it mean that a little bit of <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one point, all of the millions of atoms that make that piece of metal and the same time those same atoms are moving for up and for the down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those <unk>
In the rest of the time they are <unk>
It wants to say that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which makes the whole piece of metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is cool.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference in scale, between a single atom and that little metal is more or less than the difference between that little metal and you.
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you like that.
I mean, it's my logic that is talking about.
So imagine if they were in several places at the same time, how do it be that?
How do you use your consciousness if your body was <unk> in the time?
There are another part of the story.
And it is when it <unk> and they put the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was there in a single piece.
And I was able to get to this new, apparently all the objects in the elevator actually only are ordinary objects that are just <unk> in a little space.
You hear a lot to talk about that quantum mechanics <unk> which is all living in.
Well, that's not so much.
It's more than that, it's <unk>
It's that those actors, your connections to all the things that you around us, literally define who you are. And that's the deep <unk> of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And it took 18 months old, I had another work in Google, until I was meeting the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that is here and that allowed me to be.
It took me 18 months and me.
And so many circle and stories is <unk> with 17 museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories why we did it.
I think my own story is looking at just in this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started to travel and go to change, I started to learn a lot.
And working in Google, I'm trying to do the desire to do it more accessible by technology.
So we have a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
You know, it shows that that it shows that a couple of interesting things that we have led to place from their own.
So <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around the museums who are there are.
There is the gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite <unk> the museum of New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You go through there and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the pyramid, and with a only position we hit inside it.
They're inside, they want to go to the end of the <unk>
They continue to go back to it.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of my favorite paintings <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I see the <unk> <unk>
If the museum shows us the image, we do there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here is all the data <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click up here right now.
And this is one of the images that we have captured in what we call technology <unk>
So this image, for instance, <unk> I think about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "And what does you get to 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million <unk>
It can do it around a very simple way.
You see things that are happening.
I love this boy, his expression has no price.
But if you really hear <unk>
So I started to play, and I found it with something that happened there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I went and discovered that kids were actually playing to something.
It was a bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called called <unk> which is a <unk> with a <unk> <unk>
And it seems very popular.
I don't know why they do, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even more in deep and you'll see that you can actually get to the same.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to move up the image, so you'll see what you are.
Here is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is for <unk> a second.
So now we're quickly quickly going to go back to it again in New York.
Here is another of my favorite anecdote <unk>
The example I showed was to find was to find a details.
But what happens if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to look at how they are <unk> actually created this <unk> work.
It enhances it and actually the <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this painting, and I'm really going to get to the <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen that before.
I'll show you another of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things else here, but I don't have time of <unk>
This is the really cool. It's called <unk>
All of you, all of you, it doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives the same.
You can actually create their own museum, creating their own collection of all these images.
It's very simple, we go back -- I've created this function that I call "The power of the <unk> -- we just do a everywhere.
This is about "The <unk> in the National Park.
You can put things -- you send their friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at <unk> these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things actually don't come from Google.
No, in my mind, even it's not a <unk>
Maybe I should not say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital environment makes justice to their art work and that is represented on online.
And the great question that you do today is -- he said, "You did this for the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's for <unk> experience.
And that's everything. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good <unk> everyone.
I have something to show you.
Think about a <unk> a <unk> <unk>
In our lab, we call it <unk>
I'll tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this image of this picture, I'm all of the kids in Italy grow with this photo in the wall of his instrument, but the reason that I show you this is that it has something very interesting in <unk> in the last two decades.
It makes a few time, if you wanted to make a <unk> career, he took a budget and the <unk> to a good pilot and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a
And if the car and the pilot were good enough -- you did the career.
This is what in engineering, it's <unk> control control system.
It's basically a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today, this interesting is that the control systems are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, in the last years, have been covered from networks and cars.
They are becoming computers to <unk>
And, as <unk> are starting to respond in different ways and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is something big.
As you see aside that cities are only two percent of the planet of the planet but represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, would be a huge thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our daily objects.
This is an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for the end of year in the summer.
It's called <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms will become sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense is almost like in the old dream of <unk>
You know, when they were <unk> the <unk> says that at the end of the <unk> I took the <unk> and he sent it to the <unk> -- you actually can actually see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of capturing the environment, and I would actually write something.
Let's start with the training.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years and a half years in Italy.
It was a summer with luck 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World monsoon.
Maybe some of you remember Italy and France, and the end of the <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day to look at the activity of the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning before the game.
The line of time is in the top.
For the early afternoon there are people here and there are <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France. <unk> of Italy.
<unk> people do a quick phone called a quick <unk>
Second time from the time.
prime time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They got a lot to get a lot to get a lot of a lot of a lot to get a lot to get a lot to get a lot of a lot to get a lot to get a lot of a lot to get a lot to get a lot of a lot to get a lot of a lot of <unk>
That night they were all going to go to the center.
You see the great summit.
The next day all went to the center of the <unk> team and the first minister of the time.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time -- people are going to <unk> is a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city of a way that we didn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another simple example of <unk> is not about people, but of things we use and we eat.
Today, we know all about the side of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make a <unk> how to get <unk>
But we know very little about where things go to things.
So in this project we set up with a little little bit to track the junk in their focus on the system.
We started with a few volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, like you can see things that all of all <unk>
Then we put a little chip a <unk> and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
<unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that I didn't exist.
They're going to be complicated things and there are a lot of a lot of a <unk>
But the other thing we think is that if we look at all the days that the cup that we think, is still not somewhere in the planet.
And if the bottle of plastic that we have, a day is still still there.
So if we show that people, then we can promote some change change change.
That was the reason of the project.
My colleague of MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection, and so many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we heard at the beginning, which is going on on the environment.
And the first project is something that we did a couple years ago in <unk>
Everything started with a question of the city of the town, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of the water in public spaces.
And the question was, how can technology can technology, the new technology come to that?
And one of the ideas that we develop in MIT, in a hotel was: imagine that you have a <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It creates as a water <unk> with <unk>
If you fall in the liver, you can write in them, show you patterns, images, images,
And when we put the <unk> the <unk> was opening for that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
I liked a lot.
And they <unk> a <unk> to design the building of the <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors and windows but when you go back to it it opens up so you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered from water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> <unk> the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture appears like this case.
Those days, there are always someone, in the winter, when the roof, somebody who was there, and he said, <unk> <unk>
No, it's not that they have <unk> but when it goes down almost all the architecture goes down.
Here is in work.
You see the people <unk> by what's going on.
And here's myself trying to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened when all the sensors were left to work.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was not a building that will be open to you, but a building that was still doing <unk> and black holes and you had to come to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> and for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, always think about the use that people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always <unk>
And that's the beauty of doing things that people are used.
This is a picture of the building with the <unk> water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led to us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
So imagine that those <unk> could start to fly.
Imagine that they could have little <unk> in the air and that each one had a little goal, which changes color as if it was a cloud that comes into space.
This is the video.
So imagine an actor like that we saw before, which is moving with other in equity.
We could form this cloud,
A kind of <unk> screen like this with a normal screen in two dimensions.
Or normal but in three dimensions, where it changes is light, not the position of the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen will be in different scales and integration in different kinds of resolution.
And then it was all that it could be a <unk> cloud of the one that you can go down and <unk> and look at very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light, the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them are controlled by a person.
We can have every pixel with a competition that comes to people, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers dancers of today, the star of the <unk> of New York and the <unk> of <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use as <unk> for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk>
On the left you see the <unk> <unk> in different <unk>
It's so much <unk> 3D in real time like <unk>
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can get all the way.
And once we have the Toyota we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for the <unk>
I wanted to show the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the Olympics.
It's called <unk>
And the idea is, let's imagine another time, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment <unk> like a <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
So imagine we could do that we have all <unk> a little <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that it has happened in the last two years, we spend the last two decades, we spend the physical world.
We've explored everything like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the campaign of Obama are going to be <unk> we can move from the digital world of the networks, the physical world.
In our case, this can we wanted to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But morning it can be to address the challenges of <unk> think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how to move the digital world to the real world.
The idea is that we can do that people are going to have to do this together, social shape.
The cloud is a different cloud, made from the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, while in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered from the <unk>
You can move into the inside, they have different experiences.
You can see from down, serve to share the main moments of the Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So, it's so much a physical cloud of the sky, like something that you can go down as a new front of London.
You can get there in there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> in night, but the most important is to be a new experience for anyone who go to the top.
Thank you.
I'd like to be better than you are.
Imagine that you would tell you that, with just a lot of changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> for a more accurate <unk> and faster.
Or maybe I would like to be in better ways, to be stronger to be more <unk>
I would like to be more attractive and safe <unk>
What do we live more with good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What are you going to be <unk>
What do you think if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How much people are <unk>
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably had a lot of creative people.
That's very good.
How many of you want to have the <unk>
A few more.
And the spiritual state.
A little less.
What about the <unk>
Oh, most of us make me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
The evolution has been a <unk> issue here in the TED TED -- but today, I want to give you the watch of a doctor on the subject.
The big <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote a essay called "No biology has sense for the light of the <unk>
But if you actually accept global evolution consider this: It's just the past, or the future?
It comes to the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this <unk> well in a root is, of course, that we are more interested with us.
<unk> from a common ancestry with the modern chimps about six or eight million years.
In the time, there has been maybe 20 -- 25 species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here a few <unk> years.
It could seem to be very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in their basic machinery of our cells is more or less than the same.
You realize that we can take and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin which is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like insulin insulin but this is the same thing that it is the same thing that comes from the time.
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all took in the gut gut that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when I was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The gut is a beautiful environment for those bacteria.
It's <unk> dark, it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to have no effort from their part.
It really is just like a <unk> for the bacteria with <unk> <unk> to the <unk>
But why we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They are going to digest nutrients <unk> and we protect us from certain disease.
But what do we do about the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a <unk>
Or to be able to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the <unk>
In this large symphony of the universe, life in the Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like a only and only <unk> and the only <unk> and human life.
That was us.
And it also was the <unk> part of this talk so I hope you've got <unk>
When I was <unk> to college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the <unk> and the beauty of biology.
I love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the living organisms, each cell and all the genetic energy of that cell is <unk> to the two stem cells.
But when you look at the organisms, things start to change.
It comes into the <unk>
And something very important to the emergence of the sex policy that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the body comes into evolution in the same time of sexual <unk>
I have to say that when I was a college student thinking, well, <unk> <unk> <unk> and it seemed pretty reasonable at that moment, but with every year that was happening, every time had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that even <unk> in <unk> <unk> in their years.
And one night, someone looked at his door of hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of this is a <unk> <unk>
It looks and he says, <unk> in search of a <unk> <unk>
"This is <unk> says, "I choose the <unk>
I realized as a doctor, which was working for a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to get <unk>
I wanted to recover health in disease.
I wanted we lived more and more healthy ways.
The evolution is to pass the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like rockets <unk> designed to send the genetic burden to the next level of the next level -- and then they would be able to fall at the sea.
I think all of them -- the feeling that I looked at <unk> <unk> when he said, "I don't want to get the brakes through my work.
I want to <unk> <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily apply to longevity.
They don't necessarily apply to the biggest or the stronger or the faster, and not even more smart to the more smart and even more smart to the more smart and even more smart to the more smart and even more smart to the more smart and even more smart to the more smart and even more smart to the more smart and even more smart to the more smart
The evolution involves the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean of the ocean <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if you had fish there, fish -- yet you've been able to do that a <unk> environment.
So, what does this, when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to think about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward to the phase <unk> I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first is that I don't have <unk>
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the traditional thinking would be that through medicine, in first place, we have known to preserve a lot of other genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> of the population.
And secondly, as species, we have <unk> our environment so that we built us to us as we come back to it.
And, by the way, <unk> <unk> and so much that it is so much possible to have the isolation that we have to happen to evolution.
One second possibility is that you create a evolution of the kind of natural traditional evolution by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the discovery of evolution will be able to build slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when we kind of <unk> planets are going to be the isolation and the economic changes that can produce the evolution of the natural way.
But there's a third chance to be a little bit -- intriguing and <unk>
I call the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and <unk> for us as individuals in the decisions that you are.
Now, how could it happen.
How could we get to do this?
First, the reality that many people today, in some cultures, they are taking decisions about their descent.
In some cultures, they are choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good good for society but it is what you need to get individual and family and family to be <unk>
Think that if it was possible to be able to choose not only the sex of their <unk> but in their own body to do the genetic <unk> to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
They don't want to do those changes in their own.
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The root Project, it started in 1990, and kills 13 years.
<unk> million dollars.
At the next year of being done, in 2004, in 2004, I could get the same work for 20 million dollars in three -- four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of three million pairs of the human genome of the human genome to a close cost to 20 and a week.
Not to be a lot to make the human genome for <unk> and it will be increasingly more than all of everyone.
They come those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make virus that are not only going to protect them from them, but they're going to induce <unk> against other virus.
<unk> or there is no experimental essay in course, with the vaccine against <unk> <unk> in cells in the cells of a <unk>
You can imagine a good thing that comes from the <unk>
That's actually today, and in the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine only two little <unk>
You can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or changing the <unk> <unk> and giving their kids a better chance of a higher life for a more healthy life, to eliminate the heart of cancer?
Who doesn't want to be more <unk>
And then that same <unk> technology engine in the science that can produce changes to prevent disease is going to allow us to make <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't have the challenge of a <unk> <unk> about all if you could <unk> the next generation of the <unk> machine.
Why don't have a <unk> muscle to allow us to run faster and more <unk>
Why do I not live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions in the next generation and we can take the attributes that we wanted to have the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take 100 years ago and we can go back to 1,000 years, and maybe it was within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or your grandchildren are going to have to do with them.
We're going to use these options in order for a better society, more <unk>
Or we're going to choose <unk> different attributes that we want to do for some of us but not for them.
We're going to build a society that is more boring, and more <unk> or more <unk> and more <unk>
This is the kind of question that we're going to have to go to us.
And the most profound thing about all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and to recreate the wisdom that you need to take these decisions.
For good or to bad, and before it could be <unk> these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you are to <unk> <unk>
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day, I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only thing I could talk to the <unk>
So he immediately looked at the looked at it, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably see some <unk>
The pilot had been <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The helicopter <unk> the airplane with the <unk>
Because that's not the <unk>
<unk> the dinosaurs.
Imagine being in a plane and without <unk>
And then he said three words -- ...
The three <unk> words that has heard about.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the <unk>
I was able to see it in their eyes,
It was empathy, life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die -- these things we want to do in life, and I thought in all people who wanted to get and didn't do it, all the ones that I wanted to have and never <unk>
When I thought about that more, I came up a sentence, which is, <unk> <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to finish it.
I don't want to <unk> nothing in life.
And that <unk> really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is the <unk> the bridge George Washington, which was not a lot -- I thought about, <unk> I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes have tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also gave me place to my <unk>
And I'm sorry for time that <unk> in things that didn't think about people who do matter.
And I thought in my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your naked clock is <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces like you see in those <unk>
And while I had <unk> I had the feeling of <unk> <unk> not day.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that <unk> is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just want one thing.
I wish I could see my kids to grow.
A month later, I was in a <unk> of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And <unk> <unk> like a small one.
And for me, that was all the reason to be in the world.
In that point I knew to connect those two points, which the only thing matters in my life is a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is a good father.
It was <unk> a <unk> I didn't die that day.
And I gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and go back and to live in another way.
You know, you are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens in his airplane -- and please not be so -- but imagine and how to <unk>
What is what we're going to be able to do because they think they're going to live for <unk>
How can their relationships and the negative energy in them?
And the most importantly, they are the best parents that <unk>
Thank you.
Clearly, I've been <unk> in life with many different projects.
But the most great thing that I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk>
One day came to his house after I run and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of consciousness.
Today <unk> has a <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
So his job work on me.
I have a design and animation and animation -- so that obviously, democracy is <unk> and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> and the cause.
So I went and I met his brother and his father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What do you do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he will be able to communicate with me.
And I said, "A second, is not that <unk> I saw Stephen <unk> not that all the people with us can communicate with those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be important and you have a very good thing, you can't do it.
These devices are not saving for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate <unk>
Anybody seen the movie <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate from that way, they are going to do with the finger.
I said, "This is <unk> How can it move.
So I woke up with the only desire to deliver a button, and instead of that signed up a button, that I didn't have the less idea of how it was going to <unk>
I was <unk> with his brother and his father there on that interesting point, well, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk to you a machine, and we're going to find a way to make their art again again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who have so much in their interior cannot be <unk>
So I spoke in a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface and then, with a <unk> <unk> to be on that and translate space space.
So they go through the art of art like this.
All of the things that <unk> them, they're part of a cycle of life.
They first start with the sexual organs then with the bad words, after the Bush attacks and the end, people start to make art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And a few years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot to move the things from one side to another one had done a couple of things.
One, I chose the doors of the media companies, and we get a machine to <unk> I could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
What was great.
And, seriously, is about the <unk> I call it <unk> because I talk to the guy -- you get a email email and you say, "I don't know it. This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was bringing up seven programmers from all the corner of all the corners of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, children and I, we moved to the garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control at the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when it was <unk> would have taken the frames of the walls and in their place.
But for two weeks ago, we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They're a couple of <unk> <unk> <unk> we bought in the <unk> <unk> Beach, something from <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
We took a <unk> camera -- we put it on a <unk> light and now there is a device that's free -- -- we add a <unk> we published the code <unk> the software is low in a form of free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no safe company that tell you.
There is no hospital that can say to you.
Any person with us today has access to drawing and communicating using their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
So, at the end of the two weeks we went to the room of <unk>
I love this photo because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> for the big <unk>
And after more than a block of planning two weeks from the entire night, Tony turned to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the <unk> system and it's looking through the food system in their life.
We put the bed to be able to see.
And we put a movie about a wall of the place of the hospital.
And he turned to drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends and friends and you can imagine what it was the feeling in the <unk>
The funny thing was that we had to fit in the parking parking lot that we feel like if we were <unk> democracy as well.
At the end of this he sent us a email and this was what we would say, "This was the first time I was playing in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and he took me from there to be <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a certain way that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in movement, <unk>
And we have a long way to try with this.
It's a great device but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves this much more.
That's why we're trying to figure out how to do, and they do it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of <unk>
We've gained a lot of waste.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing with this.
All of our own pockets.
<unk> were <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in 2009, the magazine magazine will recognize us as one of the top of 50 better inventions and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what it comes to close the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of the <unk> in the center of Los Angeles is going to have an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of the urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all they're going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible to do it possible.
None of what there are in this room was possible -- the computer, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> is nothing possible in a certain moment.
Make it <unk> anything about this room.
I'm not <unk> I never did anything with recognition technology -- just I think, something and <unk> with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do all the days when we find it with something that I would feel that you have to do. If it's not now, <unk> and if I'm not a crazy thing.
Thank you.
I've spent the last couple of years -- in a very difficult way to be very difficult and at the same time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> very difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating of it, eating of the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous to the end.
In fact, in a huge part of my career I've been able to be <unk> in particular appearance with the only objective goal, in order to look at social issues in ways that would be able to be able to be able to be able to see and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I was going to do a TEDTalk on the world of the <unk> and the <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you can have heard of ear, or not, a couple weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent some messages in Facebook, some on Twitter, I was at selling the rights of the name of my moon of 2011.
What I had was the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you don't have idea about what it is about and according to content -- in the face, especially if I put it on <unk> to you or your company to do it.
But saying this, it's a very good chance to do it.
You know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a <unk> <unk>
So even with that <unk> knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you would have asked me a year -- I had no longer been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of the <unk>
And as I said before, I've been done in a horrible situation, in the last years, but nothing could be <unk> for something so difficult or so dangerous as you enter the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
<unk> <unk> I want to do a film that is <unk> and the marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call <unk> <unk> <unk>
What happens in "The biggest movie ever ever <unk> is that all of the right back to the end of the beginning, it has images of brand, all the time from the <unk> which shows out of the title.
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people are <unk> by a film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> just <unk> <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the <unk> <unk> in the title of the <unk> but we're going to make sure of <unk> all the categories that we could in the <unk>
Maybe <unk> a bank, and it gets the most great purpose that you have <unk>
The most great car, that you have driven in "The largest movie in "The biggest movie ever ever <unk> the best one -- <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show the <unk> as part of the life, make it <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the stage is the transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this movie.
That's the real idea of the beginning to end.
And I would love to be able to help us to help do it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it is the first time I hear -- is the best respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you <unk> it is very <unk> but you know how to <unk> <unk> David <unk> David <unk> How much money makes to do this?
MS: One million and a half <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it is going to be hard to the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth to convince a couple of large things.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the film will take us look like a lot of <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be <unk>
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> by the film or to be me?
JK: Both things.
MS:  It means you're not very <unk>
So, I was <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MK: We have to think about what I saw.
MS: Yes. <unk> That's the <unk> when you look at people who have to be <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought that <unk> <unk> meant to have a conversation outside of microphone.
<unk> the camera means not want to know about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one of these companies suddenly disappear.
No wanted to do with this movie.
I was born.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And it was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product to so many people as it was able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be possible.
Especially in the world today, this intersection of new media and old media, and the stage of the modern media is not the idea to tell that new vehicle to the <unk>
No, that's what I think.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this one.
We actually didn't have a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what represents this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that you can have.
I like your <unk> <unk> <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> that you think about <unk> or access from information -- to be the last line maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our political <unk> the president <unk> even the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it it really changes a lot.
But why? Well, transparency day <unk>  like that weird button, that's still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want to be <unk> <unk> history.
We want to give you a story, but it <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid and my father <unk> me in some lie -- and there is him looking at a single <unk> -- I said, "Son, there's three sides in each story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the political story.
As you see, in this situation, we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only a company, a <unk> I want to help me -- and that's just because I knew John <unk> and Richard <unk> of many years ago, I realized that I would have to go for my mind, and to go to the businesses and to go to companies and to go to companies and to go to companies and to go to companies and to go to companies
So what I started to do, and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, large giants and others who make special films like my God.
And my friends who make a large <unk> Hollywood films say the reason why their films have so much success is because of the ones that they have.
And then my friends who make young films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The biggest movie never <unk>
How are we going to see specifically to <unk>
Every time I'm going to go, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At a interview for a interview with somebody can say, "Are you very cool for this <unk>
You're <unk> You see a little nervous.
I want to help you that you are <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there is one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>
That's the general.
Now I can answer their questions and you look at <unk>
Forget this, we are a little <unk>
<unk> at the kind of little films that we are <unk> we are more well a <unk> <unk>
So we don't have the budget that have other years.
So do things like this, you know, <unk> people are the reason that we are interested with.
MS: What words would be used to describe to <unk>
<unk> is in <unk>
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you get in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk> <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you.
How do you keep care of a better <unk> more <unk> three times more <unk>
Things like those who are <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of common?
I need to talk to the man of the street, to the people like me, <unk>
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define you their <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the <unk>
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of color colors and lots and things like that.
And therefore I do I have <unk> <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The mark I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of <unk> in part of <unk> in part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of <unk>
<unk> toys in the country and in the world.
So I guess this is my brand.
In my little basement that is my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because it <unk> the <unk>
Man <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's that something?
<unk> I'm <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be <unk> but I'm often <unk> in the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed a <unk>
I needed somebody who could go in my head, somebody who could help understand what you call <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk>
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk>
If they were able to do it for them, you can probably do it for me.
<unk> <unk> <unk> right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family image.
A: <unk> a little bit about your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people are doing my way to see the world.
A: remind that world.
MS: So that world? I think your world is the world that we would think about each other, your friends, your friends, your family, the work that you do it.
All of those things come in, and they start in a place and in my case and I start in my family in West West in Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk.
MS: Next is the best day of my life."
A: How about your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like the different things.
I like the weird things -- I like the serious things.
A: <unk> of the <unk> why do you do that?
What is the <unk> where phase <unk> you find now?
Why is it important <unk> What does the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It was a little bit more about you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have <unk>
You don't have to be able to be <unk> what kind of mountain <unk>
MS: <unk> <unk> No, thank you.
A: thank you, <unk> <unk> <unk> Yes. Thank you very much. All right. All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of <unk> in all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk>
They were very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are just <unk> in one of their strong points, or in the other time to focus in both.
Many companies tend to be -- and it's nature <unk> to avoid the things that they're not <unk> to prevent fear, those elements, and you actually get a little bit of a positive for you, and you make you to see that.
What other things are like this?
The first here is the <unk> <unk>
And you can see there to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> <unk> and assuming those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> <unk> is something quite powerful.
MS: <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asked you to give you your identity of it, your personality <unk> which would be?
You're a <unk> <unk> You're someone that makes blood <unk>
Or you're more a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being <unk> to be cool as the <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> like <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> as <unk>
Or you're more <unk>
You are conscious conscious like <unk>
You are <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or fun, like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this movie we had to over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to form part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they don't have control on the end.
It allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we get to tell the story in this movie of how now they use the <unk> <unk> to identify the centers of the desire so much for the movies.
We went to St. World, where you've been able to double the <unk>
In the entire city during the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
And we went to school school, in which companies are going to become the way in schools with problems in America in America.
The incredible thing for me is that the projects in which I've had the most successful response or where I've had more success are those in which I've described with things directly.
And that is what they did about these years.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to treat the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to do to people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how did you take it off, they had <unk>
Well, since the movie was born in the daf-2 Bank, let's look at a look.
According to <unk> the movie was born in January, and since then -- and it is not <unk> we've had 80 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just a couple of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> nor press, no TV.
The film is not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even done in other countries yet.
In the last point, this film has already begun to earn a nation-state.
And it's not bad because almost all the agencies we talk to <unk> their clients will not be part of it.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get to people who are running for failure.
I think when you train train their employees in the risk of risk is preparing to the whole company for <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move on, is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that can <unk>
In the last point, we think we have to give out of fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear of risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And in order we have to filter the transparency.
Now today, we have never a little bit of honesty to a long way.
And they said this, with honesty and transparency, all my <unk> talk -- the <unk> has been introduced for my good friends of <unk> who were <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in large opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in behalf of the transparency, which happened with those <unk>
MS: It's an amazing question.
In my pocket -- I have a name to name from the TED organization of TED, the <unk> Foundation a <unk> <unk> to be applied to my life for TED in the year.
The idea behind the worm <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to take the nuclear bomb.
Their more active to develop nuclear weapons is <unk> <unk>
The boxes that you see are control systems.
If we were able to engage these systems that control <unk> and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
<unk> boxes don't use software software is a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective virus in a computer laptop used for a engineer to set up this gray box -- then we're <unk>
This is the <unk>
We started with a <unk>
The <unk> comes into the gray box <unk> the <unk> and the nuclear program is <unk> <unk>
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started doing about <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely <unk>
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these boxes -- these control systems.
That was called the attention, and we started an experiment in which we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So it was very strange.
<unk> <unk> like a <unk> rat who didn't like our <unk> <unk> but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And then we experience with different flavors of tosses and I thought, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack?
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for <unk> in the gray box if you find a specific way, and even if the program that is trying to embrace is actually working on that place.
If not, <unk> doesn't do anything.
So that was called my attention, and we started working in this almost 24 hours a day, because I said, "We don't know what the <unk>
It could be, let's say for example, a plant plant or a chemical plant in Germany.
You know, <unk> the goal soon.
And so we came up and <unk> the code of <unk> and we discovered that I was <unk> in two bombs -- a little bit and a big one.
We also saw that they were very <unk> for people who obviously had all the global information.
<unk> all of the points that we could.
They probably even know how much the <unk>
So you know everything.
And if you've heard the <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very above everything we've ever seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of you.
We're talking about 15 billion lines of code.
It looks pretty pretty old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking at the beginning of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and structures and we tried to <unk> with the real world, with potential goals in the real world.
We need theories about wealth that we can do or <unk>
So to get to care theories -- remember that it's definitely a <unk> <unk> it has to be a white <unk> and it's certainly <unk> in Iran because it's where most of the hasn't has been <unk>
They don't find several thousands of goals in that area.
It basically reduces the clean power plant of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and plants.
I called the <unk> and I went back in a effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could put the tiny digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that <unk> part of the <unk> that black object.
If you play the speed of this <unk> you can actually get <unk> and even make the <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in a obvious effort to go back to the engineers in order to get them to be able to solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the digital digital <unk> just watching the data and their structures.
So, for instance, the number <unk> comes into that code, you can't <unk>
I started looking at the scientific literature, about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every magnet contains <unk> <unk>
That had sense, there was a restaurant.
And it was better at it.
These are <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called <unk>
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in my hands.
So there was not <unk>
The results have been ahead after several weeks of work.
<unk> <unk> and we had to go back to start.
Even this, we discovered that both digital <unk> are going to one and same goal, but from different <unk>
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and the big <unk> and the big <unk> and <unk> <unk>
In <unk> we are very afraid that we have certain what the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We don't have to worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we saw really <unk>
This is the gray box and you see the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the values of the sensors of the sensors -- for example, of the blood sensors and the sensors of vibration and provide code <unk> which is still running during the <unk> with false data.
And, believe it or not, these data data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood films where, during the <unk> the camera camera feeds from video <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> at the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need global security systems where an human man could not be going to be fast.
For example, in a energy plant when the great steam steam comes from speed, you have to be able to open <unk>
Now obviously this can't do it a human <unk>
This is where we need digital security systems.
And when they are <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can grow up.
And no <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That <unk>
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a energy plant or in a <unk> factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have to be able to be able to go out of this <unk> with a <unk> <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You can also use this conventional technology to <unk>
<unk> the more possible.
And if you take that, with what you think about is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That is the consequence that we need to do.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with a huge number of goals.
We have to deal with <unk> and better than we start to do now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in a lot of sides that people realize that the <unk> is the main role behind this.
What's your <unk>
Jack <unk> OK, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My opinion is that the <unk> is involved -- but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is <unk>
There is a <unk> and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even worse than the problems in the way.
CA: Thank you, <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and the <unk> skills or the other thing that you do that users of plastic chairs and turn back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not nothing different than you put in the morning, it gives you a great strength, which also increase their speed, and help, for example, to handle balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate and connected to the universe and with other <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now in what we're working in working to talk about the American soldier that in average, has to take on his shoulder a <unk> <unk> and it's <unk> to take even more team.
Now obviously this leads to some major <unk> -- in the back in the back to 30 percent of the soldiers -- with <unk>
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the thing.
Let me show you the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> <unk> I can give you 90 pounds for a lot of hours.
Their design design enables to put in <unk> <unk> and <unk> movements with great <unk>
I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it enhances my force and my <unk>
<unk> <unk> We're there, with our deep partner to produce this device this new <unk> this year.
Well, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users users in the way I feel particularly happy.
There are <unk> millions of people involved in chairs in the world.
As one one of the population of the population population.
And this is a really <unk>
We talk about something that happens with very young people with damage in the spinal column that when you start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- running up against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be his only choice.
We also talk about the population that is going to be considered quickly.
It's just a lot of a lot of times -- by a brain exploration.
And this has been so for the last 500 years, from his successful <unk> like I have <unk>
So we decided to start to write a new chapter in Brooklyn.
Let me show you the <unk> which is using <unk> <unk> who made 19 years ago in the spinal column and as a result was not able to walk back for 19 years, until now.
<unk> <unk> Thank you.
EB: This is using our <unk> <unk>
It has a few sensors ...
This is completely <unk> in the tribes who send signs to the computer on the way on the back.
And there's also a few batteries that give power to the engines in the <unk> and in their head, and they do it move with this <unk> and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, by a strange leap in the air, and it costs the bottom -- it was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost a whole sense and all the <unk> movement.
Up time later, a doctor went to my room in the hospital, and he said, "You never go to <unk>
That happened about 19 years ago.
So he jumped up to the last few hope of my being.
The technology technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs to <unk> it costs rocks and even start in a bicycle <unk>
But haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just of soldiers, but to run, and all the users of chairs all of the kitchen, everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just come back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say about, and the game is the order of the day, where the fun is something serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, know their cousins.
This is the world of the <unk> of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their <unk> <unk>
That means that we all share a common, a real grandmother that lived about six million years.
Now chimps are known by their <unk>
But unfortunately, we have done too much about this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the biologists show the other side of the currency.
Whereas chimps are dominated by <unk> <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very audacious society, where ordinary violence is not not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the less <unk> of the big <unk>
They live in the deep <unk> and it has been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> one of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage from a violent conflict that has gone for decades, and caused almost many deaths like the World War II.
It's not surprising that this destruction is also going to be able to be able to be able to cut the survival.
<unk> <unk> and deforestation do you do it can't fill up no <unk> with the promise that they have in the world -- and I find, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos. You can hear the <unk> <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know like apes <unk> love, not the <unk> because they have <unk> <unk> and <unk> to handle conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of mankind because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> as human beings, I love playing throughout their life.
Seven is not just a game.
For us and for them and for them the game is fundamental to try and foster <unk>
With him learning <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game enhances creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game experience, you see the roots <unk> the same of the clothes, the dance and the human <unk>
The game is the glue that we were.
I don't know how to play -- but I want to show you a couple of a unique videos of the wild.
First of all, it's a <unk> game game, and I don't talk about <unk>
Here we have a female and a male young male in a half of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case to him, right?
Yes.
So the sex game is common as well as in humans.
And this particular video is really interesting because it <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the search of bringing elements to play elements -- like the <unk> and also how the game requires confidence and <unk> the <unk> and at the same time.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of ways -- some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the <unk>
And I want to <unk> this is <unk> a young woman who is playing with <unk>
I think like that, sometimes we play together, and we explore the limits of our worlds inside and outside of our worlds.
And this is that curiosity that brings us to <unk> and then the unexpected connections that we do are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that the Jackson give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future that we have to adapt to a world more difficult to more creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key of these skills.
In other words, the game is our <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But <unk> at the top of our capacity of <unk>
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
And to hire and humans in terms of life, life is not just <unk> and <unk>
When it seems to be less appropriate to play, you can be the moments in which it is the most urgent times.
And so I decided for that, I would take this gift of evolution and play together while we had the creativity, the friendship and <unk>
Thank you.
In New York -- I am responsible for a <unk> organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> <unk> like <unk> in a body of <unk>
And, in our town, where the volunteers correspond to a highly <unk> personal personal staff -- you have to get to the site of the fire very quickly to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second <unk> in the website, so I had a pretty high probability to go.
But yet there was a race to foot to the other volunteers to get to the captain to charge and find out what our task.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the <unk> which has ever moved from the worst days of their life.
We were in front of night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in <unk> <unk> while his house was in <unk>
The other guy who had had had just ever before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  He came back to the captain and this was asked to be able to be able to be able to get to the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
This was a lawyer or <unk> of money that during the rest of his life, would have to tell people that I went in a building on a building to save a lot because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to live in the house.
I need to be <unk> and he led to this woman a couple of shoes.
I <unk> it.
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> and I put the brakes at the end of the week went to the fire <unk> that to the more or less had gone out of the fire and went into the fourth of a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my helicopter around the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog in the main door of the main door in the main door of the main door in the door door in the main door of the door to the main door of the door to the main door of the mine.
<unk> on the house of the house of home where, as it was to expect, their <unk> received a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter of the <unk> <unk> by the wonderful effort to save their house.
The kindness that she looked at all over the other was that somebody had reached a couple of shoes.
Both of my writing in Robin <unk> like in my <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> of generosity and kindness in a <unk> but also in a <unk> <unk> but also <unk> and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its own.
So, when I look at this room to people who have done or they're going to be able to be able to remind me this: I don't have to remind this:
They don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in the life.
If you have something to give you <unk>
<unk> food in a <unk> <unk> a <unk>
They are great!
Not every day, we're going to have the chance to save life of somebody but each day we're going to influence the life of anybody.
So let's go to the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, 59 <unk>
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This can seem weird -- but I am a great <unk> of the <unk>
The first kind of concrete blocks is <unk> in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules in terms of a measure that fit around each other.
Very quickly, these became the unit of building more used in the world.
They have allowed us to build more big things that we, as a buildings or <unk> a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in Rio, to <unk> <unk>
It was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> <unk> came to all the home.
It estimates that you've been done over 400 billion or 75 years for each person in the planet.
You don't have to be engineer to build beautiful <unk> buildings or house.
<unk> made it very much.
<unk> simply adopted the block of a particular <unk> in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the labs. percent, the next revolution was going to <unk> the new block block of building the new building website.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a <unk> world that will take us from a <unk> world that will take us on a world of other to a world where everything was <unk>
As the block of that, the transistor allows to create circuits much more and more complex circuits at the time.
But there's a difference. The transistor was just to die.
I personally don't think that the building blocks of our time are involved to the experts, so I decided to change it.
eight years ago, when I was in the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of taking the idea of the engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago I started developing <unk>
I'll show you how to work.
<unk> are modules <unk> each other with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing about all of it is that you put through <unk>
So you can't put a wrong way to wrong way.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is the blue one, the blue is <unk> the curve and the yellow color is the <unk>
So only one of you have to put a blue with a green and very quickly can start to make older circuits to make to make the older circuits to make to make <unk>
A blue with a green produce light.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a <unk> which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
<unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have an noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually really very <unk>
Instead of having to say and <unk> and <unk> <unk> us to program using <unk> <unk>
So to make it more fast or faster, you can just take this button that makes the pulse to be faster or faster,
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection of it.
We want all the interactions in the world <unk> to <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> solar panels -- everything must be growing up.
We've given the kids to see them with them.
And it has been an amazing experience.
The best is how to start to understand the electronics of all the days that you don't learn in schools.
For instance, how does it works a day of night, or why the door of a elevator is still open, or how a iPod responds to it.
We also have led to design schools.
So for instance, the designers without experience with some electronics start with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk>
<unk> -- -- a few weeks ago, we took the middle of the American School of Rhode Island, who don't have experience some engineering, just in <unk> wood and paper and and we said, "Can something.
So here is an example of a project that have done, a <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of the dark.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to have all everyone.
So, <unk> has code open.
You can visit the page website, download all of the design and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of <unk> inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this brain world is ours.
So let's go back and <unk>
Thank you.
Now I'm going to talk to you to talk about the technological discoveries.
I work in the industry of the solar technology.
And my little company is looking for <unk> with the environment focused on in the environment.
<unk> collaboration <unk>
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> <unk> a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to get the video to a side.
No.
This is not here.
All right.
The solar technology is here.
Oh, I've already like the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I started a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians so that you take a year and work in a environment that represents almost all that we have <unk> we asked them to work on the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and they would be like a <unk> <unk>
<unk> some members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of <unk> the United States <unk> <unk> <unk>
They made big <unk> worked with the employees <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of technology technology.
<unk> <unk>
The one of the city of Boston.
Here it looks like if I look at a date, but what is really looking for is that somebody would have to get it, when you have been caught by the snow because he knows it's not very good to go on, when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to help to ask the way that <unk>
Last year in Boston had a team of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment it was <unk> a lot last year.
They realized that the city would have never introduced these <unk>
But one of the members named Erik <unk> I noticed something else, that citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did just like any good boy, I developed a application.
It's a beautiful application where you can take a <unk>
You know, you're going to be <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case he put <unk>
If you don't do, somebody can <unk>
I mean, it has a <unk>
It's an amazing application.
Maybe it's the more small of the 21 applications <unk> last year.
But it makes something that no other technology technology.
And it spreads in a mathematical way.
One responsible for the city systems of the Cape <unk> to see this application that could be <unk> not for the arm, but so citizens would have <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> <unk> but people are <unk>
So I asked the citizens that the <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just just <unk> to do people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So, now we know about nine cities that would use it.
And this has been <unk> without <unk> and natural and natural.
If you know a little bit of genetic technology to know that this doesn't matter.
And the acquisition of software is actually a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working in a project that took three people for two months and a half months and a half months ago.
It was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that I had done by the normal channels would have led to the less two years, and the next two million dollars.
And that's not anything.
Now there is a project in the power of California that until the time has again over 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
That's why a application that you have a couple of days and it is <unk> in a <unk> which is a lucky luck to the institution of government.
It led to the world's best ways to work, not as a lot of people think that should be.
Not like a technological company, but more as the own Internet.
I mean, without <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that represents the way to address the matter of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution <unk> but as an collective problem.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good for the action action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to get together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute with applications -- all the days in their own communities.
They haven't been given with the government.
They feel a great frustration to that, but they don't have <unk>
And this people know something that we have lost from view.
And it is that if we left the feelings of politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that we put in, the government is, in essence, in the words of Tim <unk> what do we do together because they're not <unk>
Now a lot of people have taken government.
If you are one of those people, I would have to be <unk> because things are changing.
It's not <unk> the government yes.
And because the government in the last sudden you have <unk> -- remember that <unk> the <unk> the way it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to <unk> <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about <unk>
This is the heart of food and information.
It's the place that the calls is if you make <unk>
Scott <unk> this call.
He said, <unk> in the basis of official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, can you open the doors.
And it worked.
But that's not the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a <unk> center.
It has a <unk> website and mobile called <unk>
I don't have that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Bureau of New <unk> <unk>
One day, this happened really, is this <unk> <unk> in my cube <unk> I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
<unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking to the person.
In <unk> <unk> all is public -- so you all can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the cube <unk> behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
He gave the <unk> I went home.
Good night <unk> <unk>
Quite simple.
This is cool. It's the confluence of digital digital and physical.
And it also is a great example of the government for the government to social <unk>
But it's also a great example of government like platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of platform.
I talk about a platform for the people and help each other.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a <unk> role.
I connected two people.
And it could have been connected with the services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and more cheap than the sharks.
When a neighbor helps another, <unk> communities.
If we call it control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about government is that it's not the same thing that politics.
A lot of people do it, but think one is the center of the other.
That our input system is the <unk>
How many times have chosen to be <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope the government <unk> our values and <unk> our needs.
That is because government is like a huge ocean and policy is the <unk> layer of 15.
It's below it is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot.
But this is that <unk> which keeps us that it is that we assumed as something that happens in our '50s, that other thing, and the consequence is losing the power.
People think policy is <unk>
If we want this institution to be going to have to do that <unk>
Because this is where the real work of government.
We have to collaborate with the government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizens worried that you've written a very detailed report of <unk> pages in response to asked the <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the science project.
That's not political wisdom, it's <unk>
And so that we have <unk> in the government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to go to us.
They really think we need to go to where we have to go without solve the institution that can act in behalf of <unk>
We can't do about government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to edit from root the function of government that can rise to civil society.
There are a generation who grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to be <unk> just there is just to put the systems of the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years ago, so I think about <unk> I'm a more generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> all go to talk.
They can express their views in any of the same time and they do.
So when they face the problem of government doesn't care about to hear their voices.
They're using your hands.
They play the hands to program applications that do better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be <unk> a <unk> you take a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Since then, we were always able to put those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like <unk> digital <unk> that we're not just consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We're more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until you don't get <unk>
So I want to ask all of the ways, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or also will be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the spinal prisons and in the death of death.
I've spent most of my life in communities and places where there are a lot of songs.
And I will be here at TED seeing and hear these <unk> it has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things you say here have impact around the world.
In occasions, if something comes to TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen a fantastic <unk>
And I think we have learned that the words of a professor can have a lot of sense, but if you teach it, you can have a special meaning that you can have a special meaning that you can have a special.
A doctor can do things good, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I don't learned this in the practice of the right, my work.
I learned my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house in a <unk> <unk> by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard it was strong, I had power.
It was the last word in the whole argument in the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was daughter of people who had been made.
Their parents were born in religion in Virginia.
So she was born about the <unk> and his experience with religion -- the way you saw the world.
She was difficult, but it also was <unk>
When I was small and I looked at it, and I looked at me and I gave me a good <unk>
I was so strong I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I returned to <unk> and I would say, <unk> I would still feel my <unk>
And if he said that no, I got a new and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that you do always want to be about it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the <unk>
In occasions, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to get their time and their attention.
My <unk> were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight -- nine years ago, I woke up a morning I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was at the other side of the room and I looked at me.
When I first thought it was a game.
So I looked at it, and she was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15  20 minutes, she got back to the room, I took the room, and he said, "Come on the hand and said, "Come <unk> <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and he said, "I would tell you something, but you can't say to <unk>
I said, "This is okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> <unk> I said, <unk>
Then I sat down, I looked at me, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you have <unk>
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "I want to do it -- three things.
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want to tell me, is that you always want to be <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I was going to go to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
Then he said, "The second thing I want to tell me, is that they always do the right thing though the right thing is <unk>
I thought and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then, he finally said, "The third thing I want to tell me, is that I never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
I grew up in the field, in the South languages, I have a brother, a higher brother, and a sister a little year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> <unk> <unk> I don't know where the sister took me to my sister and I went to the forest.
We just get doing the <unk>
He took a <unk> <unk> he gave my sister, she took a little bit and she was offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All you know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> and you always do the same thing that we are.
I took a something, your sister as a <unk>
I said, "No, I didn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What is you going to happen? It takes a <unk>
I woke up with a force and <unk> "Oh, not be that you are still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "Well, what are you talking about?
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I would probably have to say.
I know this is <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is a <unk> I say for the power that has identity.
When we created the right kind of identity, we say things to the other ones that they really don't think they don't see it.
We can't get to do things that you don't think to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been done for the <unk>
My <unk> died of <unk>
And these were the things that, according to it, we have <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different about what it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there was <unk>
Today, there's a <unk>
In America we have the largest rate of the world.
We have seven million people in <unk>
And this <unk> in my view, has changed all our world.
In the poor communities or black, you find so much <unk> so some of these facts.
One of each black three and 30 years is in jail or <unk>
In the urban <unk> of all the country in the country, Los Angeles Washington, two to 60 percent of all the men of color are in jail or <unk>
Our system is not just <unk> in front of the development, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a system that is a lot better if you're rich and I want you if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is that it is the results of the results.
And it seems to be very <unk>
The political policy and the <unk> make us believe that these are not problems.
We're <unk>
It looks interesting.
We're looking at our work with some good news.
In my state, in Alabama, and as in other states, you have <unk> of rights for always if you have an infinite <unk>
Right now, the <unk> of the black population, has lost the right to the <unk>
And if we put it back to the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before it was before the law of the right <unk>
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young people.
The United States is the only country in the world where the <unk> children die in prison.
We have in this country jail for children, without possibility to come in.
Now we are in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in the death of death.
This issue of prison is interesting.
In a certain sense we've been able to think that the end question is, the people deserve to die by <unk>
One very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There are another way of <unk> it's not to decide if people deserve die for crimes -- but if we deserve to kill you.
This is interesting.
The death death is defined by error.
For every nine people <unk> has been identified one which is innocent who is <unk> and they released from the death of death.
One rate of <unk> <unk> a innocent <unk>
This is interesting.
It was not allowed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk>
But somehow we get to us in the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue if we deserve to kill you.
It's interesting that in my classroom with students in history.
I'm talking about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted to World War II.
Actually, we don't know a lot of this.
But for the black Americans in this country, was a time defined by consciousness.
In many communities people had afraid of being <unk>
I worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what drives their lives.
Now there are older people who come to me, and they say, "Do you say, "Do you say that in our history to let people say that in our story we deal with terrorism, after the <unk>
I ask me to say, "No, <unk> that we grew with that."
The age of terrorism was obviously with <unk> and decades of <unk> and of <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic why we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our history.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've been done.
All of the time we do with each other.
We constantly created tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about <unk> I think it's because we're not willing to deal with a real process and interface.
In South Africa, people understood that I could not be able to overcome the <unk> of a commitment to the truth and interface.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany taking on the death of death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers came back after my presentation and said, "You know that it's good <unk> to hear what you are.
<unk> don't have death in Germany.
<unk> will never be able to be here.
The room was in silence and a lady said, "There's no way with our story, we could never have to go into the <unk> death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, and <unk> and we put them to <unk>
<unk> about this.
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> to people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We don't have it <unk>
It would be <unk>
And yet, there is this <unk>
I think our identity is in danger.
If you actually don't care about these issues so difficult, the positive things are, yet <unk>
We love innovation.
It was fascinated by technology <unk> creativity.
We love the entertainment.
But finally, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk>
In my mind, it's necessary to integrate two things.
I've been talking about the need to have more hope, more <unk> more than the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that it wants to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who will never have to TED.
Think about them is, in a certain way, something that's within our being.
It's true that we have to believe that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so gentle as <unk>
Technology with innovation, the development comes to not only one of the ideas.
These things come from ideas -- also by the <unk>
This connection to the heart of the heart is what drives us to look at not just a brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, the <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, <unk> for the patient -- a will be in places and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, has <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, that allows us to be really humans if we don't pay the political education, to the <unk> to the <unk>
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more difficult identity, which if we do these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet <unk> <unk>
These women were used to talk to you.
Unless the lady <unk> I call me to say, <unk> the lady <unk> and we're going to bring them to talk to you.
You want to come and <unk>
I would say, "I know I know <unk> I know that.
So she would say, "Well, and what do you do when you <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just the <unk>
It was very <unk>
And in one time, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mr. <unk> was led to me and said, <unk> <unk> which is that idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question about it.
We try to help those who have been <unk>
We try to be able to be able to deal with charity and discrimination in the administration of social justice
We try to end up with the laptop of life, no freedom for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in jail.
We try to end with the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and to finish me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> <unk> I put his finger in the face and said, "It's why you have to be very <unk> but very <unk>
I think actually, the community of TED has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way to deal with those challenges, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk> in simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is the worse to the worst thing we have <unk>
I think that's true for all the world in the planet.
I am convinced that if someone says is not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't be <unk> not that it's a <unk>
Even if somebody kills another, is not that it's a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who should be <unk> by the law.
I also think in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's not.
I really think in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think even though it was very beautiful, very beautiful, very much <unk> and it is not going to affect our technology -- for our behaviors or to our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of a society, the character of a society, not for the way they treat the rich, powerful and <unk> but by the way they treat the poor, the <unk>
Because it's in this context as we started to understand very profound themes about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> <unk> like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas are beyond my <unk>
I've been designed to these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients of 13 and 14 years ago, that have been <unk> so they were <unk> as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge to convert somebody in what's not it?
The judge <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night I was a very late night -- my God, if the judge can turn it into something that you don't know to be <unk>
Yeah, <unk> the judge has <unk>
You should ask to ask something about that.
As I was very recently, I couldn't think right, but I started working in a <unk>
He had a <unk> customer <unk> a young black.
I started to work in the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> black customer who was 14 years ago as a white <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> I had been behavior <unk> in the <unk> behavior and in the process.
There was a <unk> line, about how this country has no ethical but all of a lack of trustworthiness.
On the next morning I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or really <unk>
For my cliff not only had <unk> but he had sent to the <unk>
They took a few months ago, I had had it.
And finally <unk> -- God, I have to go to the <unk> for this case I was <unk>
I got to the car, and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I was in the car to me.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally came out of the car. He went to me.
I was going to turn up when I found it with a black man <unk> it was <unk>
When I looked at me and he said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he <unk> "It's <unk> I said yes.
So I turned me and <unk>
And I'm going to tell me in the course.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that it was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my <unk> with my identity with the capacity that we all have to contribute to the community with a sense of hope.
Well, I went to the <unk>
When the judge came to me.
And he said, "Do you know that <unk> <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> and we started <unk>
People started to get in. They all were <unk>
I was that I had written those <unk>
They got the cops <unk> <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was filled with people, all of them, because we talked about this, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I looked at the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I looked at the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking for here and for there.
Finally, this old black, with <unk> went in the room and I felt behind me, almost in the table of <unk>
A few minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
For the <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> showed up because the <unk> had in the room.
The <unk> ran on the old black.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood on the <unk> I looked at the <unk> I looked at me and he said, <unk> to this <unk> room to tell this young girl that will save his view on the goal of <unk>
I have come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very large, but they focused into justice.
We can't be really human humans -- if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
What our survival is connected to the other else.
So our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity has <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above the top of all, to those of the present to share this, I just want to keep the view of the view of the goal of <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You hear and see a obvious desire of the audience, of this community, to help them in your <unk>
Something that's not a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are a lot of opportunities on it.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is actually going to make a effort for <unk> the funding that they spend today in political policy.
For instance, here in California, they are going to spend a billion dollars in prison, in the next five years.
And despite this, the <unk> of the cases of Madagascar are not <unk>
<unk> <unk> don't get to all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that it was <unk> these funding to make the law, to security.
I think there's a very <unk> opportunity.
CA: There has been a huge <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
And part of the optimism is says that it has to do with the greatest rate of <unk>
What would you say is like this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's by the wrong war in drugs.
It's why there's a dramatic increase in the population <unk>
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal data, to take people to the chain chain to rob a bicycle, by small crimes against the property, instead of making those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about <unk> doesn't have nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have been excited about us here here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> the threats for the death of artificial intelligence.

Several <unk> War <unk> <unk> <unk>

Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months -- <unk> could be in the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media media -- they prefer <unk> visual news because our minds are paying attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses are getting many more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing does it matters more to survive, the first standing from all of those data is a ancient lobe of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The constitution is our early detection, the detector of danger.
<unk> and <unk> all the information for something in the environment that could make us damage.
So of a <unk> of stories <unk> looking at the <unk>
That old saying of the <unk> "If there's blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all of the digital devices will provide us news news for seven days of the week -- 24 hours a day, it's not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising to people think that the world is going to be wrong in worse.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe instead, what really happens is that we have <unk>
Maybe the vast progress done in the last century, for a series of forces is <unk> in such a way that we have the potential to create a world for the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good headlines climate change, the extinction of species and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings are very good for <unk> the problems and, at the long time, we have with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century, to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average income per capita.
<unk> mortality has been reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of the food of the electricity, of transportation and technology has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living in the older time of the history of humanity.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy has 25 percent over the last 130 years.
We're actually living a extraordinary time.
Many people do it.
And we keep <unk> and more <unk>
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the United States, large part of the people who live under the line of poverty have electricity, water, <unk> and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the 20th century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have been diagnosed with such <unk>
<unk> a lot of this is technology and <unk> its exponential growth.
My good friend <unk> I showed that any tool that you would think about technology of the information called this curve, the Moore's Law and double the rise of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
So for that reason that you have in our pocket is a million times more cheap and a thousand times faster than a <unk>
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things in this curve.
First of all, what it is -- in good and bad times, in the war and in peace and peace in the <unk>
It's the <unk> <unk> that used to build more quickly.
It didn't get to any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law to the left, is going to top.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> of the Moore's Law there's a lot of powerful technologies with the ones that we know about.
The computing in the cloud, which my friends of <unk> call computing computing and networks, the 3D printing and his ability to democratize and distribute production of the planet, modern biology, the vaccines and food, digital medicine.
I mean, how many of you saw the victory in <unk> <unk>
It was <unk>
I went in the newspapers the best headline that <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
It is not a easy.
It makes the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all in the mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED art, and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can be used to solve the big challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked that a company, or a product or service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade ago.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can actually be able to be able to impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, it would have <unk>
Today we can point up a <unk> of companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating integrity, it doesn't mean to create life <unk> for each of the world, is about creating a life of what possible.
It's about to take that it's <unk> and make it <unk>
You see, it's <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a <unk> story of <unk>
He is the kind of the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with <unk> and the same <unk> of gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, the sector was the most valuable metal of the planet, was more than the gold and the <unk>
So for that reason the end of the <unk> to Washington is <unk>
You see, although the sector is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth is not coming as a <unk>
It's trying to oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and made of the cheap, something as cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
<unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about a energy <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, we are in a <unk> planet for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They go to the Earth 16 <unk> <unk>
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there are good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of the solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the <unk> of <unk> <unk> rupees by <unk>
The cost of the solar energy dropped 50 last year.
The month month at MIT ran a study that shows that the end of the decade, in the United States, the solar electricity cost six cents the <unk> for hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have loads of energy we also have loads of water.
Let's talk to the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Qaeda. I wrote the spatial Space towards the Earth in 1990, after I spent <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live in a planet.
We live in a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is <unk> two percent, the two of the water is ice and <unk> by the <unk> of the planet, but there's a hope.
It's a technology available for 10 -- 20 years, but right now.
It comes the police, the <unk>
And in a conversation with Dean detection, this morning, one of the innovators of the <unk> I would like to share with you, I gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> -- the size of a small <unk>
It is able to generate a thousand liters of water to the day of any source <unk> <unk> water -- a <unk> for less than two cents a <unk>
The president of Coca-Cola has just been going to make a major proof of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If it comes to it, and I have all trust trust that that would be, Coca-Cola and put it into <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation for this technology that today, today.
And we've seen it.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent of the phones in the developing world for the end of view.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has best better than a quarter of Kenya in a half of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell a smart cell with Google, has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a <unk> world and communication that nobody could have ever seen.
You know, the things that you and I have paid and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars <unk> video and music, technology of books and music, technology <unk> now <unk> and they lose value value in the phone.
Maybe the best get it when it comes to the applications in health.
The month month I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation -- something called the <unk> X <unk> 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams in the world to be able to get these technologies in a mobile device with which you speak and because it has <unk> you can be <unk> you can be <unk>
To win it has to do better than a medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the world in which there is no doctors, where the <unk> <unk> is 25 percent of health.
When this device <unk> a pound of RNA or DNA that didn't be able to call the health of health and in first place, you'll avoid the point.
But this is the greatest force to produce a world of it.
I call it a billion of it.
The white lines of here are the population.
We just have to spend the mark of seven billion dollars.
By the way, the best protection against the explosion explosion is to provide the world and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people in the line, they come in.
By 2020, spending two billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before it was done to the global conversation.
What do you want these people?
What do you think about <unk>
And instead of a economic growth, we have the greatest injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillion dollars <unk> in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health because of a better education with the Academy of the Academy of the Academy of the Academy of printing and computing in the cloud will be more productive than never before.
What can you give us 3,000 million members of humankind, healthy and <unk>
What about some voices never before you <unk>
So what if we give you all the same, wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and they can act for the first time?
What do you do about these 3,000 <unk>
And if they are role that we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X Prize is that small teams led to their passion with a goal of of course, you can do things -- things that before they could only do the big corporations and the governments.
I'm going to end up with a story that really <unk>
There are a program that maybe some of us know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game in which people can take a sequence of amino acids and we find the way that you get protein.
<unk> determine the structure.
It's a very important thing in research research.
And, until now, it was a <unk> problem.
You have played with this teachers in the others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people are done and started <unk>
And it has been shown that today, the machinery of recognition of human patterns is better <unk> protein than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have 3,000 million minds that are <unk> to work in the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have for a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before you give you three examples for doing time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here like you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
It's actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It took it a lot to the decade of <unk>
Now the fish is in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times about Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have any special.
But the case is that we still come to the U.K.
We even think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, it also illustrates another <unk> the <unk>
Because I was there in <unk> studying a <unk> in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I grew up to work in Africa.
I thought it could <unk>
I became a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not from there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
He was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, of a few <unk>
There was <unk> of about 20 percent, the <unk> <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good time, so it was made more of the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years after the amount of fish had reduced in half.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> a genetic pressure.
There was no fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Asia.
In the 1990s <unk> started in the <unk> Europe did a lot of developing projects.
The developing development was driven to the countries that had already 100,000 <unk> <unk>
And this very, very nice boat was called <unk> four.
I went to fish in it, and we did studies in the South China of China -- and especially in the Red Sea.
What we studied was something <unk>
<unk> now the bottom of the sea.
90 percent of what we studied was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> small about a few <unk> estimates that are <unk>
In short, the bottom of the sea came into the covered and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary -- because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you make a study and then it starts <unk>
The bottom is going to be a red <unk> in this case to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were <unk>
Once we captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to be <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain mountain is what the fishermen are going to be going to a area that you have never seen.
But there is no <unk>
<unk> the world but we don't know it.
<unk> the point to start a new level, without remember what was there.
If you think about this something like that.
In the axis -- and we have a lot of <unk> <unk> in the country, the supply of water.
And that changes with the time changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation to use the <unk> images at the beginning of their own life of their own life, like the normal and the extrapolate forward.
The difference is to make the loss of loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the <unk>
And at the end to keep a few <unk>
And that, in a lot of measure, is we want to do now.
We want to keep things that you know, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem is connected to the people when societies -- kill animals without knowing what they have done to some generations later.
Because obviously, a animal is very <unk> before you <unk> it is a little difference.
You don't lose animals <unk>
One loses a little bit of smart animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great <unk>
With the time, we focus in the big animals and in a sea sea of large fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
With time you have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we do this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> which was very different.
And they will be going to be going to be in a previous way that they would expect to have evidence.
For instance, the anecdote that some <unk> as a captain like captain and such a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or therefore general doesn't use the scientists of the smoke because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in societies -- because they don't trust the sources of the past.
From there the huge role that can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Because with the ancient areas -- we actually actually prioritize the past.
<unk> the past that people can't think because the climate point has been done and it's extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a protected area and they can benefit from the vision that <unk> what enables you to erase their <unk>
And what happens to the people who can't do it because they don't have access as people in the United States, for <unk>
I think there was the arts and art, maybe you can fill the vacuum.
This is a <unk> simulation of <unk>
It makes a lot of time a lot of time there was in the Bay Bay 500 years ago.
And you have noticed that the <unk> and the <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about what people were done with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why <unk> with <unk>
Because it gets something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only thing to convince you is to <unk> <unk> <unk> under the water.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I am Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> and I look at the YouTube video of the <unk>
It's true.
So today, we will see why the videos are done and what importance has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger -- that seemed something very, very hard.
But today, this web makes any of us, or from our actions, <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Whatever can be famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They get more from 48 hours of video hours a minute.
And, of these, just a little percentage of a <unk> gets a lot of <unk> and makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of <unk> communities and factor surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God.
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> ran this video theater from his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the rise of the summer of the summer,
<unk> I didn't have to do a mathematical video <unk>
I just wanted to share a <unk> <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There was already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> ran this <unk> <unk> to the video to the <unk>
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> us present new things and interesting and <unk> to a larger public audience.
Me, <unk>  It's 29 <unk> There are the <unk>   They all want to get the end of week last weekend.   <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  KA: They don't think that we can have this conversation without talking about this video.
<unk> <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed seemed to have came out of it.
So, what did I do this day?
Well, I was <unk> it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also <unk>
But what did I have this day, this Friday in a doctor.
Well, I took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> <unk> <unk> was one of the first people in doing a joke about the video in Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a <unk> group of trends built a view of view, and they share with a <unk> public audience.
So, this community of people who share this great <unk> then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there's 10 <unk> <unk> in YouTube.
So only in the first seven days, there was a <unk> for each other days.
Unlike the global entertainment of the 20th century, this human participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon -- or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with a <unk> music.
It's so that's everything.
This year saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird -- you know that there's a three hours that has seen four million times.
Up until the cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that woke out between the <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody did a version of the old man.
And then it was international made.
Suddenly the whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a stupid joke to something that we all can form about it.
Because we're not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have something like that.
Who could have <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What do you do could have been written to be <unk>
In a world in which you get two days of video days for minute, just the only only only one and unexpected can <unk> the way these things have done it.
When a friend said to me that I had to see this great video of a guy who laughed at <unk> <unk> in New York, I'm going to be interested in a very interested in me.
<unk> <unk> I was <unk> by <unk> but often there are obstacles that make you circular <unk>
KA: Thank the real effect and their humor, <unk> <unk> I managed to five million looking at the idea.
So this approach is worth a whole new way that we do a creative way.
And all of this brings us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this?
<unk>
KA: What does this?
The creators of <unk> communities are creative <unk> are features of a new kind of media, in a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defined the <unk>
As I said before, one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> started in YouTube.
They didn't get permission to express their ideas.
Now we all are a little bit of our culture.
These are not the characteristics of old people, but it's just the media of the media today, but we will take the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man exposed the work from a whole life.
It's a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope and freedom of their country.
<unk> while the <unk> go into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been entirely in all.
The words, for so long time I friends, friends, now it <unk>
It's <unk> in the silence.
He died in the story.
He is my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our <unk>
My grandmother never allowed me to forget their story.
My task was not to let that has been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but the <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at the dawn <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> had just 18 years ago when his father died, and an marriage marriage and two girls and a little <unk>
For her, life had been inspired to a <unk> assignment of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for she who couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> of four years ago that we do is a boat -- a boat on the sea <unk>
All the adults know the risks.
The most fear of the <unk> and death.
As the majority of adults, my mother had had a <unk> with <unk>
If we were <unk> first of my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are out of that boat, the constant rate of the engine, the <unk> <unk> in every <unk> and the horizon and vacuum.
I don't remember those who came in several times, but they were <unk> with the courage in our boat, or the engine dying and not be able to do for six hours.
But I know the lights of the federal platform in front of the coast of <unk> and the young man who had had and died, and she died, the first apple that I decided to give for the men of the platform.
No apple had after the same value.
After three months in a refugee refugee camp in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> whose population is <unk>
Unlike the suburbs of New York, whose existence was <unk> in <unk> I had no sense of the right.
The smells of the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> <unk> between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in <unk> then in a factory of cars, working six days like <unk>
Even this, I found time to study English and get a <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
We were poor.
And all of the dollars were <unk> and we put a <unk> in English and mathematics, not matter what it would be <unk> that usually was <unk> <unk> always was <unk>
Two <unk> pairs for school, one to play the holes of the other.
A high school to <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there was rare <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk>
The home, <unk>
Something in me are <unk>
I was <unk> and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I was <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we <unk> on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my homework was to be <unk> until their <unk> started to be <unk>
She opened a computer store then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women came with their stories about men who could not do a <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and boys and <unk> boys with between two worlds.
They looked <unk> and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in worlds.
In a one, it was the <unk> <unk> <unk> with what they <unk>
In the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives <unk> by violence, the drug of drugs and the isolation.
But many of you were used for the years.
And for that job, when I was studying my last year -- I introduced the young <unk> of the year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but their <unk>
And so <unk> <unk> <unk> was now that <unk> <unk> and social, invited to talk about sites that had never heard -- and in houses whose existence would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to go to the <unk> and the <unk> of life in a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters end the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of every single and <unk> <unk> the three in the same bed.
And I said to my mom who couldn't do it.
I remembered that I had now the same age that she had when we put it into the ship.
<unk> had ever been a choice.
<unk> said to me, "This is not what you don't know.
So I spoke about <unk> and education and <unk> and <unk>
And the more crazy -- I was more <unk> to talk to you.
I met people from all of the roads in life, many of them doing what we're going to be able to live in the border of it.
And although I finished my <unk> I realized that I couldn't stay in a <unk>
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that is good to be a <unk> a new <unk> in the scene -- and it's not only -- but it's something that is probably because it's a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the <unk> of your <unk>
He gave the enough steps out of my <unk> area to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we could.
<unk> who didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, a <unk> <unk> a lot of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> to a little group of people who the slogan can't be <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, it made a giant <unk> of soup that all <unk>
<unk> until the night.
Most of our ideas were <unk> but some bright <unk> and we open it up.
He took the decision to move to the United States.
After a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before the end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was social justice and the local <unk> was the person who matter.
Life had no changed for centuries.
His father died just after she was born.
The mother grew up.
At the 17 became a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without their husband, he created a <unk> to the <unk> and to take the cause she -- and so much more <unk> caused when I could.
You can't be able to be wrong.
I was in the <unk> in the fourth of a hotel in 2010, when she went to 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> <unk> and I saw it on the other side.
I knew she had come to <unk>
My mother called a minutes later.
Forget later, we went to a <unk> <unk> in <unk> and we sat around their <unk>
We tell stories and make sure we were still with it.
At the night a <unk> came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> your hand.
I asked her <unk> "Why their hand is hot, and the rest of the body as <unk>
"Because you have taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
Don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since those who we were and how life comes together now we can see that the men who would have to be <unk>
<unk> would have <unk>
Now I want to have my own children, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could look like that for it?
However, I fear the privilege of what's easy to it?
I can give you a <unk> in their lives, <unk> <unk> in every <unk> the <unk> rate of the engine, the vast horizon that don't know nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could take them and see it -- you do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is now here in the fourth or <unk>
My story starts in <unk> a few years ago.
I was in the desert, under the sky, <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were a conversation of how it has nothing changed from the age of the old <unk> <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with <unk>
In that time when I was at the great prince warrior <unk> I had <unk> he took a bow and a <unk> to the ground, they got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we had was that the machinery had replaced to magic.
And that was <unk>
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would give me this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a <unk> if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't do my friends.
I looked at the technology I had to allow <unk> not <unk>
My grandfather gave me her <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this piece of 50 years of 50 years was to my real thing.
It became a <unk> door to a world with <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
And I had the feeling of that the phones, <unk> <unk> and the cameras they get them to <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
That's why I was <unk> to this technological world to see how to use it to create <unk> instead of <unk>
<unk> books from 16 years.
So when I saw the supermarket, I saw a <unk> device able to connect the readers in the whole world.
You can know how to take the book.
Where do we are.
They put the text with the image, the sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But why do you do that?
I'm going to launch <unk> an interactive application for iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each other.
And so --  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I put a character of the book.
In a few times a <unk> -- the moisture knows where I live in the GPS -- which comes to me.
My little girl are excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean and <unk> but to the magic of childhood, to those ideas that are <unk> of children.
For some reason, fireflies are always always exciting.
So, for here, we have to look at the moisture to release fireflies.
And, of truth, they turn your way in the way that the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated for me was that a whole galaxy <unk> in a <unk>
So here, every book and every single world became a <unk> which I would put into this rare device inside the <unk>
And this opens up a map.
In the whole book of <unk> has always been maps but they've been <unk>
This is a map that goes up and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go back.
Another very important aspect for me is to create content of African content and <unk>
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people were in India know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor people have been born in the cameras cameras in a <unk> in an old and <unk> book.
That's why we're bringing it back in a <unk> story.
And in a story that is about current issues like the environmental crisis.
And, talking about the environmental crisis, one of the last 10 years, has been that the children have been <unk> <unk> to their <unk> have not come to the world.
But now with the mobile technology we can take our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure where you have to go back to the outside, take the camera or the orange and collect images of different organic objects.
I had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason you don't do it.
So to recover this high childhood detail that you have to go and in an chapter, <unk> a photo to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
This makes a collection of pictures that then can put on the Web.
A kid in London put a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And they believed this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the <unk> of connection between <unk> the Earth and technology has many possibilities.
In the next book we have to have a interaction where you come up with the moisture and the video turned out, and by reality, it looks like a <unk> group that comes on the plants.
At a moment the screen is filled with leaves with you.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature is <unk> with technology and magic and technology is going to each other.
<unk> the power of the sun.
We're closer to our kids and us to the natural world and to that <unk> joy and love to sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many different projects.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we let the patients.
And one of the things we did in the University of <unk> was <unk> to a director of it.
And not in a very specific way, she had a little cup of coffee or you and I asked them to patients, family and <unk>
"How can we get <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the greatest problems for what all all of us or maybe not all of the projects of <unk> <unk> because we let you hear.
This is my <unk> <unk> It's a very simple.
It has a <unk> <unk>
All the morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge like you can see.
I put the challenge to get 95 <unk>
But it is so simple, that every time I would give me to get my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as long and he can see what my problem of weight, not at the same time that you need <unk> or some tone of that way, but it turns up.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than <unk> in Twitter.
So, every morning I connect to my <unk> <unk> and before to climb up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need a <unk>
That's the best thing that it can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for the patients to stop it.
On the other hand, can be <unk> to move people from their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control.
On the week of the week to be available here.
This little <unk> connected to a iPhone or another device.
And people are <unk> from their houses, taking their pressure <unk> to their doctor, and to share with each other, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they're going to recover control and to be <unk> from their own <unk> but also can help us health care because of the challenges that we face as the <unk> of the cost and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage the patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did would like to do with you with a video video.
We all have <unk> controls in the <unk>
So maybe we have in our mobile car.
We know perfectly <unk> <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find <unk>
But where is the more close to help this patient?
We said, but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saving lives at this moment.
What we did was to do it in the <unk>
We created a Web, and we asked to the public public <unk> you see a <unk> please <unk> <unk> and when it's open, because sometimes you open in <unk> and other are closed.
And more of 10 <unk> already was written in the <unk>
The step step was looking for the application for that.
And we did an application for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you are in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> can use their iPhone, and the few weeks to use their mobile cell cell to find the <unk> <unk> what can save lives.
And from today, I would like to present this, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also like <unk>
And we want to take the global level.
We're <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so we can help us find, work and act like a center for the <unk> of the <unk> around the world.
Every time you have a <unk> and somebody <unk> can be a function or someone in front of you, you can find.
I also want to invite companies in all the world that could help us validate these <unk>
They could be <unk> services or people in <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> which shows is still in their place.
Please do it in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or it's <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, are photographs that you can't take with their cameras.
My interest for photography was woke up with my first digital camera at the 15 years.
They put up with my early passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because when I use the camera the process was in the <unk>
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk>
For me the photograph had more to do with being in the right place in the right time.
I looked like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start the <unk>
<unk> like this: A construction <unk>
But it has a <unk>
And, despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and <unk> and the fact with the common goal of keeping the level.
And when I say, "I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want to seem to be captured in a way like photograph.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to figure out the trick.
It has more to see with an idea that we can capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it really clear.
They're the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What does the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end of our way it is about our way to play the world and how you can perceive in a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is <unk>
So I think the <unk> are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality that we took different pieces of the reality, and we put them to create a alternative.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three serious objects -- something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But there are a certain way you can create something that still looks like <unk> as if I was born.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So, <unk> the brain because the brain is not done that it really doesn't have sense.
And I see the same process to combine the pictures.
It really is actually in combine different <unk>
And the things that make a picture look like realistic I think they're those in which we don't even know the things that we go around in our local life.
But when we combine these pictures is very important <unk> because there are something wrong to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that are going to be going to get results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures should have the same perspective.
Second, the <unk> pictures have to have the same kind of light.
And these two images do with these <unk> were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to do impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
It could think that this is the image of a landscape and the lower part is <unk>
But this image is completely driven by pictures of different places.
In the personal job, I think it's more easy to create a place that you find out because you don't need to put the ideas that has in your head.
But it requires a lot of <unk>
And as I thought this idea in winter knew that I had several months for <unk> to find different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For instance, the fish was captured in a <unk> journey.
The shores are in a different place.
The <unk> part was captured in a <unk>
And yes, even a red house on the top of the top of the island, so it looks like <unk>
So to achieve a result of realistic I think it makes a <unk>
It always starts with a <unk> a idea.
Then you have to combine different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you make a good job to take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and sometimes a very beautiful time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I want to show a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, can be <unk>
It's a diagram anybody who took from a challenge.
I'm not interested in so much to show you the details but the whole aspect of it.
It's about a analysis that we were doing about the power of the <unk> <unk> versus the power of the local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this is a lot of other that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on the scale.
In other words, every step of here represents an order of magnitude, in the scale.
I'm going to talk about technology with curves -- it's something else.
So here's something strange.
And that precisely I'm going to talk.
Please turn the lights.
<unk> <unk> because writing about paper.
Why do we have <unk> curves in <unk>
The answer is that if you draw them into a normal curve that I say, these are the years, or some of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that would like to do, the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like that.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you get to be some other technology, like transportation, it is a <unk> curve, it would be very <unk> we would see a straight line.
But if it comes to something like this, it gives a <unk> change.
If the technology technology is just as fast as the <unk> of <unk> last morning we could take a cab and being in Shanghai in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There are no common in the history of the technological development of a <unk> growth that every few years ago of magnitude.
The question I want to do is -- if you see these curves <unk> we see that they don't follow it.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
<unk> one of two things.
Or do you make in a typical curve -- I know like this until it was all entirely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that it can happen.
I'm definitely why I think maybe it will happen something like that.
It would be in the middle of a <unk>
In this line we're in a transition of what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask me, what is that new way you take the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very <unk> if we are running on it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what happens in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future is still the year of 2000.
That's all that we see.
In other words, the future is <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it has to feel that something is going on.
It makes a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot to think about 30 or 50 years because it all will be so different than Dai what we're doing today doesn't have any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it could be, how could it be that transition that we <unk>
But to do that will have to talk about a little bit of things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer.
Because I think the only way to understand is taking distance and look at the long-term things.
The scale of time I would like to do it is time in the Earth.
I think this image has sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back about two million years ago when the Earth was a great rock rock with a lot of chemicals that <unk> around them.
If you look at the way that we organized these chemicals we give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin of <unk> I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and is that, at that moment, there was a lot of <unk> of oil with all kinds of recipes in their inside.
Some of those blocks of oil came up with a particular combination of chemicals that would make them put materials from the outside and so the Germans grew up grew together.
And they started <unk>
In some sense, those were the largest mobile forms of oil.
But those sketches were not alive in the sense today, because each of them had a recipe of chemicals.
And increasingly, <unk> a distribution distribution of the chemicals that <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the sketches that somehow would be used to be better to the time to put the chemicals -- <unk> <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more.
They were already more <unk>
It was a form of life, life, very simple, but things are interesting when these apples learned the trick of the <unk>
So somehow we don't understand very well these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe of the cell in a special chemistry called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution -- a <unk> system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to be <unk>
The incredible thing is that that <unk> system, it seems to have remained stable from that evolved a half billion years.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same <unk>
In fact, every living will be living with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things that I did just -- we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> from the white powder that I try to hide people from the security people.
But <unk> took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this diagram of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if you want to 100 million copies of my personal office, I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it into a virus and it would have spread by the room.
What was the next <unk>
I'm writing the DNA was a interesting step.
This did that these cells were happy other billion years.
But then there was another interesting step in which things are <unk> very different and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicating information to make information in cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for that way, for example, engineer resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid <unk> and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria with other bacteria and now there are a lot of <unk> because the bacteria are <unk>
This communication gave place to be used communities -- in a way, they were together in the way, and they add a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all of the individuals of that community -- and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the point of innovation happened when these communities were worried so much that in fact, came together and decided to write all the recipe of the community on a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And in that stage, we have communities <unk> communities in many kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The cell cell is not the heart of the heart, or the <unk> or the brain, so on.
So, these communities evolved and had more interesting more interesting than the phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process in community.
They are <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that makes the information that those these communities built together.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community of the community of <unk> understanding and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage of it.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was <unk> to the duration of a organism, and not the time of time of time.
So, a organism -- for example, learn to be able to be able to be able to be able to eat a certain fruits because he knew the last time I could.
That could happen for the life of a organism because they had built these technological structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years for the death of individuals who ate that clear.
That's why the fact that the nervous system built these structures of information that we have reduced the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to a individual.
It could happen in time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So, for instance, the more <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we thought, it is an amazing invention here.
I have a very complicated idea, a <unk> idea.
I'm here sitting here in a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar situation, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that has been a certain analogy with mine.
But we took a very complicated thing to change it in sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to do <unk>
Now we spend a lot of similar to the <unk> organisms.
For instance, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on.
And that makes us in something much more large, faster and able to evolve more than we do before.
Now evolution can happen.
You saw the <unk> language of <unk> in which produced a certain evolution with the <unk> program.
And now we have <unk> the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story that I told you for a billion years ago.
The next person, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
<unk> language, they took less than a million years.
And the 1980s, like the electronics, seems to take just a few decades.
So the process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that you know their own pace of change.
How else does you do it.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see that the process is <unk>
But I put life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> they would not be able to be possible without the real developments of America.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine.
There are thousands of dollars.
Instead of that, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think a <unk> level, we put it into the machine and the machine with that makes something that was not done, it gets far further and faster than never before.
In fact, sometimes spending methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting, particularly interesting, I've been using <unk> is the evolution itself.
We put inside the machine a evolutionary process that happens in the scale of the schools?
And, for example, in the most extreme cases we can evolve a program from a sequence of a sequence of instructions.
We say, please have a hundred million sequences of <unk>
You could run these instructions from <unk> to kill all of those programs, and you take those that more <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to take numbers, to put a simple example.
So, we find the programs that are more going to make numbers.
Of course, you have to have a few <unk> sequences of <unk> <unk> so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, he was able to find two numbers in the right order to go.
And I said, <unk> could take 10 percent of those computer sequences that best did the <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> to the rest of them.
And now we have the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a <unk> process.
Let's take two programs that <unk> children, and the children are <unk> the properties of both programs.
So we get a new generation of programs of programs that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please know, the <unk>
<unk> again.
<unk> some mutations ...
And it comes to new and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So, I can do the equivalent to millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in cases complicated, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are trying to test numbers of very perfect.
In fact, they're a lot more efficient programs that I could have written to hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how to work.
I've tried to be <unk> to see how they work.
These are programs <unk>
But the <unk>
In fact, I have the security that you get the goal because they come from a well-known distinction because they come from a pile of hundreds of thousands of programs that they could.
In fact, their lives are going to do it.
One time I was going to be in a <unk> <unk> and you get a card and he says, "Look this.
He says, <unk> has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to provide a <unk> <unk> you don't feel <unk>
We know that the engineering technology doesn't work very well when they become <unk>
So we started to depend out of the computers to do a very different processes.
And that allows us to produce a lot more complex things that makes normal engineering.
However, we don't understand about all the options that you are.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
Now we use those programs to do a lot more fast and so they can use these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing is getting faster and so I think it looks like that.
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we are in a moment to respect to the <unk> organisms.
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we're going on.
We're in the point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very <unk> of our part to think that we are the global product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what it's going to be.
But now it comes to lunch and I think to stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've been able to get enough enough to let me give a part of my fake <unk>
Before we treat the topic of my talk, let's talk a little bit of distance.
Why not?
We're about the end of the end, the <unk>
We love it. Right?
<unk> is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to be <unk> the <unk> talks about the statistics, and we use it to form a great team.
I focus on one of them and hope that many of you know the stories.
It's called <unk> <unk>
And we talked about <unk> of a <unk> which is <unk>
That means the <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball to the field of game without being <unk> and that anybody who are <unk> to the first time, you don't go to time, and the second basis will be <unk>
Three attempts of 10.
You know how to call a <unk> <unk>
Well, it really well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how to call a <unk> <unk>
By the way, that's somebody that we have 10 <unk>
<unk> like Mr. Ted forgot the last player of the historian <unk> of <unk> in <unk> in <unk> in a regular season.
Now let's take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more <unk> or maybe less likely to tell you today.
Imagine that you have <unk> and they have a surgeon that has also a record record in <unk>
This doesn't work, right?
Now assume that you live in a place, and a <unk> has two <unk> <unk> and his family doctor came up to a Party whose record <unk> is <unk>
But you know something?
She is getting a lot of this year.
And their talks have been <unk>
This is not working.
But you ask you.
What do you think should be the average of a heart surgeon or <unk> in a nurse or a <unk>
<unk> very well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in the medicine knows the <unk> of a good goal, or <unk>
What we do, though, is the <unk> in the world, and I focus with the <unk>
I could ever ever have a mistake and <unk> to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in American school.
I was a <unk> student.
One time, a town, in high high school said that Brian first, studied to a blood test.
There is <unk>
<unk> in my little <unk> at the dawn of General General General <unk> not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
In my class, <unk> the origin and the work -- the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
And even known the diagnosis is about how to activate the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very brilliant, I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> of the drug school with the impression that if you find it, then they would know everything -- or the most possible, close to all of the things -- because it was <unk>
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a <unk> in a college hospital here, when they brought the lady <unk> to the <unk> service.
At the time I was given to the <unk> service.
And when I promise to remind a barrier, I was going to go to that patient to come into that patient.
And to report to the boss of <unk>
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a sound <unk>
And when the <unk> I heard a sound <unk> in both sides -- what I was going to have a <unk> heart failure.
In these conditions the heart leaves and instead of <unk> the blood down, the blood goes into the lungs, these are <unk> of blood, and so there's hard to breathe.
And it wasn't difficult to <unk>
I did it and I started to work on the treatment that would be <unk>
He gave them <unk> and <unk> to alleviate the pressure in your heart.
And I gave them <unk> water from water, so I could eliminate a <unk>
And in a hour or two, she started to feel better.
And I felt pretty well.
And there was when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
Actually, I made two kinds of things.
He sent her home to talk to the boss of <unk>
I didn't get the phone and I did what I should have done to be called my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, it would have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a <unk> which is <unk> attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that could take care of my patients without even contact my love.
The second mistake that I did was worse.
When I send his home, I didn't put attention to a voice in my interior who was like, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it.
In fact, I was so unable to asked the nurse that I asked the nurse to <unk> the lady <unk> <unk> which is good if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said to complete <unk> "Yes, I think it's <unk>
I remember that if it was yesterday.
And so it was that he signed up the tall, and the ambulance along with the continents took her home.
And I went back to the room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the nose.
But I kept my work.
At the end of the day, <unk> to leave the hospital and walked into the parking site where I was my car to go home, at the time I did something that I don't do this.
It happened for the <unk> service.
And there was another <unk> not that <unk> of the lady <unk> before, but the other. I told me three words, those three words that most doctors of doctors <unk>
Others who are afraid too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and it is that we see the patients <unk>
The three words are <unk> <unk>
It's known of the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with <unk>
"Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I returned to the edge of death.
At a hour of a hour to have come to his home, after I gave me the tall, he had a block and his family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of <unk> which means a <unk> blood pressure of <unk> which means a <unk>
I just know, and there was blue.
The personal staff <unk> all their resources.
They gave them to climb up the blood pressure to go.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the spinal cord.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in socially therapy and waiting to all hope that it was <unk>
And in the two or three days to the next couple of days was obvious that you never <unk>
He had a <unk> <unk>
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> what was happening.
And the ninth day, the left to go. The lady <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say that you never have the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks ago, I was <unk> for that and created for the first time the <unk> shame that there is in our medical culture, and I felt -- <unk> without feeling that shame healthy because you can't do with your colleagues.
One makes the <unk> and it would never make that error.
It's that shame that leaves a diet.
Shame <unk> that I talk about is that it makes us feel very bad for it.
It's the ones that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And so it does.
And it wasn't by my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure that I would do things and the things that I didn't get to me.
And I kept just those questions.
Why didn't I asked my <unk> Why did he sent to your house?
And in my worst <unk> why did a mistake as <unk>
Why did I choose <unk>
Just like that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in a day <unk> he opened the sky and eventually came the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a try with me in which if you get the efforts to be perfect to be perfect to be able to be able to do that voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it turned to happen.
Two years later, it was <unk> in the international department in a community in a community north of magnitude, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he ran up here.
I looked at her <unk> I was a little <unk>
<unk> <unk> and he sent her home.
But while he went back to the door was following his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my change to put up my head and my head asked to talk to me with me in his office.
And I got three words, they know this?
They remember the patient who saw by a pain in the <unk>
Well, he returned and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had an active condition called <unk>
You can use it in Google. It's an infection, not from the need, but it can be open down, and that can cause the speed of those <unk>
him, luckily, she didn't die.
It would be <unk> antibiotics by <unk> and you know a few days.
And I went through the same time of shame and <unk> and I returned to work, and I returned to work, until it happened and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of <unk> not <unk>
And it's a big effort, especially to work in a hospital, because it was <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, they didn't sent home and I don't think there's a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk> but it was normal a colleague who was looking at, the patient <unk> some sensitivity on the lower lower and called the <unk>
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
The liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague that I did it.
He looked at it, and you'll see some sensitivity on the lower right right -- called the <unk>
Both of them were <unk> and they were pretty well <unk>
But every case was <unk> I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most powerful have been for the last five years.
<unk> <unk> and no support.
And here is the problem: if I can't work and talk about my mistakes if I can't find the <unk> which tells me what really happens, how do you do with my <unk>
How do you show you this for the same <unk>
If I were going to go now to a place like this, I wouldn't have a sense of what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard to you to talk about a thousand miles after a thousand miles after that.
Of course, that in a party heard about the mistakes of other doctors, but you don't hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg, that would have to have to do in look at the eyes.
This is the system we have.
<unk> of the <unk>
It's the system in which there are two <unk> which make mistakes and the ones that you want to be <unk> and the ones that have <unk> results and the ones who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get from medicine to the people who make mistakes will be a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years about spread and journalism journalism -- I've done a personal study of bad <unk> and errors to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what I learned is that the mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where the mistakes happen every day, in which one of every 10 drug drugs in the hospital are wrong, or it's not right in a system, and more <unk> causing chaos -- and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die 24 <unk> by errors <unk>
The American Institute was established 100 dollars.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we have.
And so they are things.
A <unk> system, where the knowledge is taken every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
<unk> <unk> all all all of it.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to do a perfect story of a patient with pain in the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in your chest and it comes to <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with <unk> and suddenly my story was <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do the things the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't get their symptoms always in the same way.
All this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get <unk> and we eliminate all the professionals to mistake, well, they don't have anybody.
And with that people don't want to talk about their more <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white art -- it's already a habit to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the continents to the boss of surgery -- "This is my worst <unk> -- <unk> -- "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone for them.
And their students are <unk> <unk> your head and <unk> and started to tell their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to do that.
<unk> can say, "Look, don't do the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The medical doctor, is the human knows -- the human knows -- and they won't be proud of their minds, but we will be able to learn about what happened to teach others.
<unk> their experiences.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people are not going to want to <unk> but in a <unk> way and support to support them.
And it works in a medical culture that recognize that human beings are going to get the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes rather than time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I am a human <unk> <unk>
And I feel a lot of but I have to learn something that can transmit others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me end up with three words -- I read it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day.
You know how much we choose in a week?
I just did a survey over 2,000 people and the amount of choices that says, choose a half of the day.
Not a lot of a lot of a week in a week to a group of <unk>
The researchers had the different jobs <unk> by these <unk> and the time that we were able to make decisions with those tasks.
They found that in average, <unk> <unk> work a week.
Let's do each work with lots of <unk>
Half of those choices took nine minutes or less.
Only one percent had had a hour or more of your time.
Now think about their elections.
Do you know how many <unk> at nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do you play the way that we treat those <unk>
Now today, I want to talk about one of the greatest problems of the <unk> choose to the age of options.
I want to talk about the problem and a few solutions.
When I talk about this I'm going to do a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When you do a question -- like I am you to slow up the hand only if you want to burn calories.
In another way, when you do a question, if your answer is positive please give a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, are ready to hear to talk about the problem of <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this <unk> very, very <unk> at least in that time it was very sophisticated
It was called <unk>
It was almost like to go to a <unk>
There was like 250 different kinds of different types and <unk> more than 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of water -- and this was when we were taking water from the <unk>
I loved to go to that store, but in a minute, I asked me why I would never buy it?
This is the <unk> <unk>
They had more in 75 different class, including the ones who were in the box <unk> that comes from trees.
Once I decided to visit the manager and I asked her, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed up with the buses filled with <unk> that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
It goes.
They had <unk> different things.
<unk> <unk> just at the <unk>
We put there with six <unk> or in 24 different <unk> and there are two things: First, where case people were willing to stop the <unk>
More people come out when I had <unk> a 10, that when there was only six, a 10 percent.
We also look at what case was more likely to buy a <unk>
So here's the opposite.
And so you stop when there was <unk> only three three to buy <unk>
And so I had six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the <unk> the people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were done in a quarter of that if they were born on it.
Well, decide that we didn't buy <unk> we would probably have <unk> <unk> less good to save the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the presence of choices will affect us in <unk> decisions.
We decided to be able to recognize it, even when this is not <unk>
Now the subject of the day, the financial savings is now.
I'm going to tell you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in which we look at the decisions on the age of a million Americans, in between a few Americans, of this country.
We were interested in to see if the number of <unk> funds available in order to buy the <unk> program <unk> to people saving for the future.
And we discovered that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that were going from two, to 59 different options options are.
We found that the most of the <unk> number was <unk>
So if you look at the top, we see that in the plans that you have two <unk> the death rate was about 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that <unk> about 60 percent, the death rate went into the <unk>
It turns out even if you decide to do, when there are more choices, even in that case, there are unintended consequences.
So for the ones that decided to do, the most of the number of choices, more people are going to be able to be able to avoid their actions or the funding of investment.
And in terms of the most choices, they were more willing to invest in financial landscape.
But none of these dark decisions are the ones that we are <unk> to optimize the modern health of the future.
In the decade we've seen three major negative consequences to provide the more possibilities.
The most likely is that it would be <unk> the decision that the <unk> even when this is in the own interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in our health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though you see it better.
The main reason is that it would be able to look at that variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we're not able to do the calculations for <unk> and to choose that amazing <unk>
Now today, I want to look at four simple techniques that we have <unk> a way or another, in different research, so they can try in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You heard before, but it has never been more true than today, which is less more than today, which is less more than today, which is less than today.
People always think when I say, <unk>
They care by losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you wanted to be able to put rid of <unk> choices -- <unk> there will be a increase in <unk> <unk> the costs will be a better experience in the choice.
When <unk> & <unk> country in 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, you saw a increase 10 in India.
When the corporation <unk> <unk> <unk> the products to be <unk> of cats who are less <unk> by the <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> higher <unk>
You know that the rise of today, in average provide 45 products.
In a grocery store, you have a hundred products.
But the biggest department in the world is <unk> and it provides only <unk> <unk> a kind of sauce <unk>
In the world of modern savings -- I think one of the best examples that you've been talking about how to manage the choices is the <unk>
All of the employees of Harvard are <unk> automatically to be <unk>
What they really want to choose you have to choose you have 20 percent, not 300 or more.
You know that people says, "I don't know like <unk>
They're all options <unk>
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there's between those options.
And if their employees can't be <unk> they can't be able to do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer the people from this audience a few paid to the most paid to the most beautiful <unk> of the world.
Here a <unk>
I want to do it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> whatever is ready to accept the deal.
They're not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think it really understood to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you have more information in the first mysteries that in the first step, but I can <unk> and say that the second time was more real.
Because the images would make it be more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the presence of <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each other, and the consequences have to feel very much <unk>
Why do people spend 15 percent, even more than the average time when it uses credit cards or TED.
Because it doesn't seem for real things.
It turns out to make it more real -- it can be a very positive tool for people to get more to the other <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
At that meeting, that <unk> exactly like <unk> we did a little <unk>
So what we add was that you would get to the staff that would think in the basic things that we would think about their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a increase in the <unk> of 20 percent, and a increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more samples than options.
For instance, this is a study that we did in a <unk>
We saw that in <unk> <unk> throughout the <unk> <unk> the exhibition of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the another, <unk>
If you think about the left is <unk> and the right of the right is <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
If you think about the left is <unk> and the right of the right is <unk> <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The bottom of the left is <unk> and the right of the right is <unk> but you know something?
So this framework is completely useless.
<unk> need to be able to be able to do something that the <unk>
We often see this problem with those huge <unk>
Who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk>
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we thought, if only the <unk> a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity ago.
I'm going to show you an example of what I want to say.
Let's look at a good decision to do a car.
This is a German <unk> <unk> which allows it to <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to put a car.
And these decisions look at the number of options that provides each one.
<unk> color outside of the car, I have <unk> possibilities.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is vary the order to make decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from a lot of choices, based on a few of them, four boxes.
The other half of clients are going to go to go in a few choices, four <unk> <unk>
What am I going to <unk>
What do you are.
If you get <unk> always the button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that we have a lot of options to share -- <unk> the button and again and again and again and another time.
The <unk>
If you have a few options to many, they continue to be there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was driving the order that the information.
If we started the easy, you learn <unk>
Even though you choose the box of changes that I don't say about the preferences of <unk> but all of all ways to make us <unk>
We are excited about a product that we are building that now has been more <unk> with the process.
So for you.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can handle more samples with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've heard of them were designed to help drive the <unk> or better, to use them in their issues, or for people who are going to work.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is being careful to the <unk>
And the more careful we are in our choices better to practice the art art.
Thank you very much.
In the years of <unk> in Germany -- <unk> if you had a <unk> machine.
He had to record a piece of text of example written with the machine.
And so that the government could track the origin of <unk>
If they were a written with the wrong message could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't figure out that somebody could do this, so much that this is <unk> the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color of any big car, and it makes a page, that page will end up having a few yellow yellow yellow <unk> in every page that makes you own and their printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments are using technology in all of us, citizens.
And it's one of the three major causes of problems in the network.
If you see what happens in the world in line we can put the attacks with their <unk>
There are three main groups.
They're the <unk>
As Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, a few years.
There are actually a lot of a lot of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthieu <unk> <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> on the line, but they do it for the media <unk> with <unk> <unk> to rob money from our challenges when we bought in <unk> or <unk> our key to get information from our cards when we bought in a <unk> computer.
The secret service of the United States, two months ago, <unk> the dawn of this guy, <unk> <unk> and this means I had <unk> millions of dollars when it was born.
Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I say today, today is more likely than any of us is a <unk> of a <unk> which is a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong in worse.
In the future, most of the crimes of war <unk>
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There are another thing that the media, are going to give you the <unk> the <unk> are going to tell you the <unk> <unk>
<unk> as pets, have <unk> in the last 12 months ago, a role on the attacks online.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> the criminals that do it for money, the <unk> as <unk> that they do to do, and the last group are the United States governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That is a good example of <unk> government against their own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority or actually it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
<unk> security from the site and <unk>
The week last week I asked in a meeting with <unk> government <unk> I asked one of the leaders -- if you <unk> the death of people to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So, how do people die for a heart attack.
<unk> is a <unk> authority ...
<unk> <unk>
What does the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services <unk> services like <unk>
Unless a <unk> authority <unk>
And that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring, and those things have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt <unk> the headquarters of the secret police of the secret police <unk> and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of <unk>
Among those papers was this Seligman, called <unk>
And within that tradition, there was notes of a company with <unk> in Germany who had sold the Egyptian government to intercept a huge scale of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for <unk> by <unk>
The center of the company is right here.
But the West governments can provide tools to government governments to do this to their citizens.
But governments are also doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, a couple of weeks had been found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by American government to investigate their own citizens.
If you have a <unk> in a <unk> case, it's pretty obvious that his telephone is <unk>
But this is more there.
<unk> the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like the <unk> <unk> to embrace our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think about things like these the obvious response should be said, "Well, it looks like something bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest.
Why do you start?
I don't have anything that <unk>
And that argument doesn't have sense.
It's in play.
It's not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy to security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could be trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we do today, to be forever.
<unk> <unk> in any future, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that we have done in the next 50 years.
Here is where I live involved in Kenya, in the south of National Park.
These are the cows of my father, and behind the <unk> the National Park.
The National Park of Nairobi is not <unk> in the most part of the South, which means that animals like <unk> like <unk> <unk> outside of the park.
And predators, like the <unk> and this is what they do.
<unk> our won.
This is one of the ones who killed for night, and so soon we got up in the morning and we found it, they had been pretty bad because it was the only thing that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of the lions.
They were dying to protect our community and livestock and they're also <unk> with the problem.
So kill three.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park.
A kid in my community, in the age of nine years, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that I was going to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use it, because I thought the lions would give them to fear.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because even starting the lions to see the <unk>
I don't have <unk>
One second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to ask the lions so that I believed it was about the <unk>
But lions are very smart --  <unk> the first day and you saw the <unk> and the second day, he remained and they said, "This thing doesn't happen, -- it's always here.
So one night, I was walking around the <unk> with a torch and that day, the lions didn't come in.
I discovered that the lions have fear of light to the light that you have.
So I had a idea.
And I got a turn with the way to turn and turn the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell car, and the battery <unk> the electricity to the tiny box <unk> I call it a <unk>
And the box <unk> makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> turn into outside, because that's where I come around the lions.
And that's how you see it, when they come from night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> the lions to think I'm walking by the <unk> but I am looking at my bed.
Thank you.
So I put in my house two years ago and since then, we never started to have problems with the lions.
And the houses in the neighborhood would hear the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
And she had killed a lot of animals and the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see the <unk> these are the lights for three.
Since then, I've taken up in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea also uses now for a whole Kenya, for <unk> to other interests, like Solly -- and also is using it to be used to measure it for <unk>
Thank you to have the <unk> I had the lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools of Kenya, <unk> International School,
My new school now is helping raise funding and <unk>
Even led to my friends to my community and we set up the lights in the homes that you don't have, and I teach you how to <unk>
So, a year ago, I was just a kid in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the cows of my father, and used to see airplanes and he told me that I would be inside of one.
And today, I am.
I had a chance to come into airplane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to be an engineer engineer and pilot when it was <unk>
I used to hate the <unk> but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and to help, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You know, the exciting thing is to hear a story like you.
So you get a question: Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working in other electrical <unk>
What's the next in your <unk>
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a <unk> electrical <unk>
<unk> I know that you already invented the <unk> <unk> but I want to do mine.
CA: You know, you know, a time, and <unk> <unk> I have tried before, but I received because I got a <unk>  CA: When I got a <unk>  CA: The foot of <unk> Richard <unk> are something big.
We're going to be <unk> in every step that I would do with my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up and grew up a song called not <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In the school, we were looking at all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South America, Japan are the enemies.
Even though I wondered about the rest of the world, I thought would happen all my life in North Korea.
When I had seven years, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I had never been sick.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter to my sister.
That would say, "When do you do this, the five members of the family members of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family.
We're <unk> together in the floor, and our bodies are so honest that we are prepared to die."
I was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
As a little time, when I walked in front of the train, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
One woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child <unk> in their arms looking at the face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned to take them and their families.
A huge unit was born to North Korea to <unk>
In the end, over a million World War died during the wild, and only a few people can eating <unk> and the spinal cortex.
They also made more and more <unk> the <unk> of energy, all my things around me was completely completely dark in the night except by the lights of sea in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always asked me why they had light and we don't.
This is a National photo of North North America in the night compared to the U.S.
This is the <unk> <unk> that serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing there to West crossing <unk>
But many they die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating on the river, in the river,
I can't reveal the details of the North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of AIDS was sent to China to live with <unk>
But I just thought I would be separate from my family for a short time.
I'd never have imagined that he would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like <unk> <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but it's also dangerous, because the refugees in China were considered <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destiny in North Korea.
One day, my worst story was actually done, when I was putting up by the Chinese police and <unk> in the station of police.
Somebody had been diagnosed by being <unk> then I would get my skills in the Chinese language, and they did a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to grow up.
If it didn't seem natural it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to finish up.
But I managed to control my emotions and said questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer said to another, "This was a <unk> <unk>
And they were left to go.
Some century in China are looking for <unk>
But many of you can be <unk> by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Even though the <unk> were eventually launched after a lasts pressure of an international pressure ago.
These were not so many luck.
Every year, we've been captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> <unk>
Even though I was lucky to find a lot of other ancestors have not had so much luck.
It's tragic that the wars, have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after to learn a new language and finding work, all their world can be <unk> in a second.
It's why after 10 years to hide my identity, I've been able to go to South South Korea to South America.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much higher challenge of what I could.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start to learn my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a huge gap between North and South Asia.
We are all <unk> but over inside, we have become very different because of <unk> <unk>
Even in a research crisis.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where do I say about? Who said.
Suddenly there was not a country I could call with pride to mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan. I started to study for the <unk>
Right now, when I started <unk> to my new life, I received a <unk>
The United Nations authorities <unk> a little bit of money sent to my family, and as my family was going to be inspired to the force of a location of the <unk>
They had to be able to get it back.
So I started planning how to help you escape.
<unk> have to travel long to the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to crossing the border between North Korea, and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and <unk> to the border with North Korea.
Because my family could not talk to Chinese, I had to be able to do -- in some ways, for over three miles across China and then through the South Asia.
The journey in <unk> I took a week and almost we went through a few times.
One time, our bus was arrested and <unk> by a Chinese officer.
He was able to remind you, and started to ask you questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came back to my family, <unk> I put myself and told me that they were <unk> who was <unk>
I looked at me -- but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to democratize the guards <unk>
But even after to spend the apartment, my family was arrested and incarcerated to crossing the <unk>
After paying <unk> and we're hoping of my family was liberated in a month old.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in <unk> capital.
This was one of the richest spots in my life.
I did all of letting my family, and we were so close to my family, and my family was <unk> in prison at the middle of the United States of South Korea in the South Korea.
I was and came up between the office office and the station of police, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man, "What is the case.
I was so surprised that a stranger would probably do to be done.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without <unk> the man was at the Bank, and the rest of the money for my family and for other two of them and to get them to prison.
I got <unk> with all my heart, and I asked her, "Why do I start?
I'm not <unk> I said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a good moment in my life.
The kind of <unk> <unk> a new hope for me and for the village <unk> when more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of the creativity, and the support of the international community are really the belief that the village <unk> needs.
With time, after our long journey, my family and I met us in South Korea, my family.
But to get their freedom is just half of the stream.
A lot of <unk> are separated from their families and when it comes to a new country, they start with little or nothing of money.
And so we can benefit from the international community with education, including the English language, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea, and the rest of the world.
Because many of us keep in contact with family in the right thing, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of aid and inspiration in my life, so I want to help a <unk> a chance of <unk> with international support with international support with international support to international support with international support with international support to international support with international support with international support with international support with international support with international support with international support with international support with international
I'm sure you're going to see more and more <unk> <unk> around the world, including in the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I live in South <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So the city of the city came together and they said, we're going to change the name of the South Center so that it represents something else, so that they changed to Los Angeles as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
As they <unk> millions of other Americans, living in a <unk> <unk> Los Center in the places of food to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to take people in the car.
People are dying of <unk> <unk> in Los Park.
For instance, the growth of obesity in my neighborhood is five times more that, say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I would see that this will happen.
And I ask me, how would you feel if they didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go back to the time you see the effects of the current effects that has been in their <unk>
I looked at <unk> <unk> and they sold as a <unk>
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this has to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
In addition to me to drive 45 minutes and back to buy a apple that doesn't have <unk>
What I did, was we put a <unk> forest on my house.
In a <unk> <unk> we call a <unk>
It's about 45 to three me.
The point is, which belongs to the city.
But you have to come in.
I said, "Well, I can do what I come in <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
And so it was like I decided to go.
And so my group and I, especially <unk> we put them and we started putting our forest forest from the food, trees -- you know, nine everything.
What we do, we are a kind of <unk> group of all the <unk> of all of the city and completely <unk> and all we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone got <unk>
The city is going to me on the city and <unk> I gave me a <unk> saying that I had to take my hands on the <unk> the <unk> made <unk>
And I said, "Come on, in it?
One order to grow food in a piece of land that nobody <unk>  So I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time was not going to happen.
Long City had the story written by Steve <unk> and I spoke to the <unk> and one of the members of "The <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, you go, why not?
Today, it's the city of the United States with more <unk>
It has <unk> miles from <unk>
That comes to 20 Central <unk>
That's enough enough to grow <unk> million plants.
Why does the hell don't think about this?
<unk> a plant will give a little bit about 10 <unk>
When a dollar dollar will give you 75 dollars.
It's my <unk> when I say people, it is your own food.
<unk> your own food is like to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
I grew up to my kids there.
I was going to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> my art.
It's like a <unk> artist. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I use the edge, the land, like a piece of <unk> and the trees, and the trees, are my <unk>
You see what the land can do to do, if you leave it to be his canvas.
You just can't imagine the amazing thing that is a <unk> and how it affects people people.
What happened?
I mean, I am like how my garden became a healthy tool.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the earth.
We're the earth.
You see how to do it affects children.
<unk> is the <unk> act and decided to do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember a time that came up with a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my garden, and they see very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that you were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like that.
This is in the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who was so close to me, and this is just <unk> why do I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't know that people will rob your <unk>
What I say, "Why?" I don't have afraid that you go to <unk>
So that's in the street.
That's why it's all about.
I want the <unk> but at his time, I want to <unk> his <unk>
There was another chance that I put a garden in a <unk> shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys who helped me download the <unk>
It was a lot of my stories about the stories about how this had been affected and how they used to grow with his mom and his grandmother, and it was a fabulous to see how it was so only for a moment.
This is <unk> <unk> has come to <unk> maybe 20 <unk>
We've had a number of 50 people who go, work and <unk> all in the plan.
If kids are going to get <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you get <unk> <unk> <unk>  But if nothing about this is <unk> if you don't teach you how the food affects the mind and the body, they eat things that you put in front of them.
I see young young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which you're supposed to see these boys of color that are in this path designed for them, which is not <unk>
With the <unk> I see a chance that we can train for these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who you know?
Maybe you have the next George Washington, <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my experiments, this is something I want to do.
I want to put a whole block block where people can share food in the same place.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into <unk>
I don't think about me.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, is you have to be <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people from the guys to get kids from the street, which is the pride and the honor to grow their own food, opening markets.
What I want to do here, we have to do <unk>
I want you to all become <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
<unk> take their <unk>
That is their <unk>
In <unk> if you want to try with me, well, if you want to look at me, you know, if you want to sit on a comfortable chairs and having meetings to talk to make some <unk> to talk about doing a <unk>
If you want to look at the garden with her <unk> so we can put something.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> --  <unk> <unk>  <unk> -- probably all agree with me in which this is a very <unk>
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive -- but there's not always, especially in days like today, where it goes.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that <unk>
And especially if you go on his bicycle and these cars -- that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can do a lot of noise.
It's a <unk> material and if we build moisture as in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we want a <unk>
The solution for that is to do roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, and the water can pass through it, so all the water water flow into the sides and you will have a road to go into the sides and you have a road and not <unk> water.
The noise also came into these <unk>
Because it's very busy all the noise -- so it's a very <unk>
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is it <unk> you see that in this road <unk>
First of a button, then many more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more, and they do -- well, I don't do that.  But they can enjoy their <unk> and they're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more harm.
Sometimes you can create <unk> with that.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> of course, you can convert in a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see how the damage in this material.
It's a <unk> <unk> like I said, so it only has a little bit of <unk> between <unk>
Because it's because of the <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if you get <unk> they will become <unk> and they come from the <unk>
So, if you drive on the road, you get the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is using <unk> <unk> of that to clean <unk> and we can cut the <unk> <unk> and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of <unk> <unk>
Then you need a machine, like you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
The <unk> can rotate up and it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel, to get the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> and the rocks is <unk> back to the surface of the surface.
This was using a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great machine of <unk> here on the stage.
It's a similar <unk>
I put the sample that I'm going to take to see what it happened.
This is the show that comes on now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We took a lot of samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting.
So we took a piece of road, 400 meters from the <unk> <unk> where we had to do an essay to test this material.
So that was what we did in there. You see where we were doing the proof on road, and then, of course, this <unk> last year without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples of this road and we tested in the lab.
We made the face together, we put a lot of burden in them, and then with our <unk> machine.
We can do this a lot of times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we have done a material using international fibers of steel, -- these vessels using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, even they save the life of the surface of the road, even save a lot of money with very simple things.
And now, of course, have curious about if this also worked.
We even have the sample here. It's pretty hot up.
Actually, it has to cool first before you can show you how to show you how it does it look like.
But I'm going to do a lot.
Let's see Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years ago, I remember a couple of a morning with the sound in my house.
My father was listening to the BBC <unk> in his little radiation.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual in those days, because the news usually <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> <unk>
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now I can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I never forget.
A truth.
You see, I was six years ago when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and they did illegal that girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a kid for <unk> to my biggest sister that could not be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two we could <unk>
Every day, we got a different way for no nobody could <unk> where <unk>
We had to hide the books in the market for which it looks like we were <unk>
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us in a little room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk>
We all knew that <unk> our life, the students and our parents.
Instead of when, the school became a week -- because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they know what they knew of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where <unk>
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote <unk> in which his daughter, my mother, my mother, was going to school and so his father <unk>
But my mother were <unk>
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to convert our home home to girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their kids had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk>
For him, there was a higher risk in not giving their children.
For the years of the <unk> I remember I had moments that I was very frustrated for our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything that you have in life.
You can hold your money. You can be able to leave your house for a war.
But there's one thing that would always be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we're going to do it.
So you don't want to be <unk>
Today, I have 22 years.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age of my age have more than the middle of my age and if my family had not been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find here proud of <unk> in <unk>
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> of his home for the courage to educate their daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He was not only <unk> from my <unk> <unk> but I also was the first woman, and I am the first woman that I wear it on the streets of America.
My family believes in me.
I would dream in large, but my family has even more big dreams for <unk>
It's why I am the global era of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's why they <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which is still driven for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to take the opportunity.
And I look at their parents and their families who like my mom -- <unk> for them, despite even in front of a <unk>
As <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you your face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
less than a month, he and his daughter were going to go back from <unk> to his village, and literally, <unk> of being killed by a bomb on the way, for a minutes.
When you get to her home, they are the phone, a voice, a voice, which if I was still sending his daughter to school, they will go to me.
<unk> now, if you <unk> said, "but not enjoying the future of my daughter and <unk>
What I've given me from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who are <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and that sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, often are the first <unk> the first <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of the men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school, remember, was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in America.
I find that the Americans see the fragility of the changes.
<unk> that these changes are not a lot of a lot, after the <unk> of the United States.
But when you go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who would get to them, and I see the <unk> I see a <unk> future.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> I was <unk>
Like me, they are going to be in large.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But you never become a <unk> <unk>
They've been almost two years since the middle of the <unk> revolution inspired by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> as much of the <unk> revolution.
One forces with a lot of other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of <unk> and start a revolution against the <unk>
And the <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and men were young <unk> were in the <unk> <unk> the each of the <unk> <unk> and social justice.
You have shown a <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
You have shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> Middle East, to the west to the south.
Finally, after a six months of six months of war and a few of about 50 thousand people -- we can release our country and <unk>
However, <unk> left a <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and seeds of <unk>
For four decades, the regime <unk> <unk> the infrastructure and the moral structure.
<unk> from the cybercriminals and the challenges, I've thought many other women, reconstruct civil society <unk> a transition and <unk> towards democracy and the <unk>
There was about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the top of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of <unk> I went back to Libya and with a single <unk> I started to organize workshops on the developing development and skills of leadership.
With an incredible group of women started the <unk> of <unk> <unk> by the <unk> a movement of women, <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk> of the woman and for our <unk> <unk> in the building of democracy and the peace.
I found me with a very difficult environment, in the period of the period -- a environment that was increasingly <unk> which is <unk> of political policies and <unk>
With time, our initiative was <unk> and successful.
Women won a <unk> Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, just as recently, the <unk> of the elections and the revolution as a all, they were <unk> every day of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the American police and the attack of the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the police police of the Army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> copyright rights and their lack of respect of the law.
Our society, made by a <unk> <unk> and it has been away from the ideals and early freedom, social, social justice that we had at the beginning.
The <unk> <unk> and <unk> became the light of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today to do with our history of the success of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the election.
More good I'm here to remind us that we, as a nation, we choose wrong, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because the choices didn't get peace and the security to go.
The list <unk> and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and <unk>
No, they didn't do it.
What happened to it?
Why do our society are still <unk> and it dominated with <unk> <unk> and <unk> by both men as for women.
Maybe what it was supposed to were not just women, but the values of the values of compassion, nasty.
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more of what I needed the election, which is just <unk> and the <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> more to need the representation of <unk> and <unk>
We need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> and to call them a couple of anger.
We need to start to act like compassion agents and cars.
We have to develop a <unk> speech that is not just <unk> but it also would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have the intellect, the collaboration in place in the competition -- the <unk> in place in the <unk>
These are the ideals that a <unk> <unk> for the war, need to have the end of the end of the order to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is the <unk> and the <unk> between <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to do that in a bad way before we do it <unk>
I agree with a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> -- the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions <unk> it has the same root in Arab -- which the word <unk> <unk> and <unk> which affects all the humanity that men and women, which all the tribes and all of the tribes have <unk>
And so, as the <unk> is completely <unk> the <unk> matrix of compassion compassion all the existence.
And so we would tell us "My <unk> <unk>
So he says, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
They all would get to the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
I am here today to tell you about a question -- which has a equally good answer.
It's about the secrets of sexual violence and the question I'm going to address is the ones that you all do -- why she is <unk>
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not <unk> or social <unk> no drug in violence.
I just am a woman with a story that <unk>
He was 22 years ago, I had just <unk> at the University of Harvard.
And I had moved to New York for my first work as a writer and she was <unk> in the journal <unk>
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> and I had a very big secret <unk>
My secret was that many, a lot of times, the man, I believed my soul <unk> <unk> to the head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The guy who loved more than nobody in this world, put a <unk> in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> of love, where every year every year and even some men.
Until it could be his story.
I don't get a typical <unk> of their violence.
I am a <unk> at the University of Harvard and I have a <unk> in <unk> of <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent the most part of my career working for companies in the list of the list of the list of the list of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and The Washington, <unk>
I have almost 20 years ago with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and it's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that public violence can go to anyone, all of them, all of us, all the <unk> and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that you all think that violence is happening to women, which is a problem of women.
Don't exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the rich <unk> only happens in <unk> <unk> and <unk> or <unk> in families, the last place where we would want or we hope or we would expect to be able to be able to be able to be able or we would expect to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able or
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going to be used with a man who came in, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
He was 22 years old, and in the United States in the United States of 16 and 24 years of age have three times more likely to be victims of the domestic violence and girls and girls and girls and girls in that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the United States.
I also went to a typical victim because I didn't know anything about the sex violence -- their signs of <unk> or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, and the night of January.
I was sitting at my side of New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first was that he had also had <unk> from a college <unk> <unk> and I worked in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what I was fascinated at that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a guy in the field.
He had a few <unk> <unk> and a <unk> hair and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most smart things that made <unk> from the beginning, was creating the illusion of the <unk>
He made it above all of the <unk> <unk>
We started coming out and I loved all of me who was <unk> who had gone to me to help girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and <unk>
<unk> believed in me, like a writer and like nobody had done before.
And it was why I was in that <unk> school, and the work in Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much importance for it.
I didn't know that the first phase in any food relationship is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York and to leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do that, for your couple, so <unk> left my work and <unk> and I went together with Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was running in a <unk> <unk> who was entering a <unk> <unk> which was in a <unk> <unk> and psychological psychological <unk>
The next step in the pattern of public violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it is.
And here is where you go into scene those <unk>
In terms of us moved to New York, you know, that site where I was supposed to <unk> I had to feel so safe and bought three <unk>
One had in the <unk>
And another thing he looked below the curve in our bed and the third always in their pocket.
And he said that I needed those <unk> to cause the support of a tiny.
I needed to feel sure.
But those <unk> actually were a message for me, and though I never had to put my hand, my life was already in serious <unk> every minute of every day.
The first <unk> <unk> <unk> was five days before our wedding.
They were seven of the morning and still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 title of my neck had <unk> I put the suit of my mother and married to me.
In spite of what had happened, was sure that we lived happy for always, because I loved me and he also wanted me a lot of a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It was just very <unk> for the <unk> and by the fact of form a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident. And I would never have more to hear it.
I spent two times more in our moon <unk>
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and he <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head of the car <unk>
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of the moon of the moon of the moon of the moon and sent me a Big Mac <unk> to the face.
<unk> remained <unk> one or two times for the next two years and half of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only in this situation.
One of every three American women is a <unk> of violence or collaborators at some point of his life, and the Center Center in order to be given that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million children are <unk>
So actually, I had very good leaders.
I'll go back to my question: Why do I start?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was running from me.
The contrary, I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply strong, <unk> and it was the only person in the world that could help us <unk> their <unk>
The other question that all the world does is why they just don't have <unk>
Why did I not <unk> I could have been at any time.
So for me this is the most sad question and suggested that people, because we know the victims, we know something that you normally have <unk> is incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the <unk> in cases of domestic violence happen after the United States, there was the end of the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has no longer to have it.
And all of us include the <unk> <unk> even after the <unk> has become to <unk> <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the United States and their children, which are usually forced by the judges to spend time and their children, which are usually forced by the judges to spend time to be <unk>
And yet, we keep wondering why you just don't go in.
I was able to go to go from a last <unk> I would have to take my denial.
I realized that the man who loved that, I would have killed me if he would have been <unk>
So I forgot the silence.
I told him all the world to the police, to my neighbors, to my friends and family family and family and family and family to <unk>
We have the trend to <unk> the victims like headlines <unk> women <unk> <unk>
The question, "Why are you <unk>
And for some people is a way to say "The <unk> is <unk> by <unk> as if the victims -- <unk> <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I started <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> who learned a <unk> lesson of what happened and that <unk> their lives lives and happy and mothers, wives and mothers, and mothers, and mothers, saving lives of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I am actually a victim and a <unk> of public violence.
I went back to <unk> with a <unk> <unk> and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to have to have ever else, is a <unk> <unk> to my head in hands of somebody who said to me.
In this moment, well, they are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I haven't been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people, that you are listening to right now, who are going to be <unk> or they were going to be <unk>
The <unk> could be affecting his daughter, to his sister, to his sister, to their best friend right now.
I was able to put my crazy love to my crazy love to get the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last petition to you.
Talk to what you've heard here.
Bad abuse just in the silence.
They have the power to end with the free violence simply put light on the light of it.
The victims need all around the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of their violence.
<unk> the <unk> talking about it with their children, their colleagues and family.
<unk> their vision vision as people and <unk> who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the existing signs of violence to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get their <unk> and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together, we can convert our apartment, our web and our families in the <unk> and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call myself <unk> and for a time, I am model.
To be <unk> for 10 years.
And I feel that in this moment there is a kind of uncomfortable in the room because I should not have a dress like that.  luckily, I've brought <unk>
This is the first <unk> change in a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of luck <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> you don't have to be <unk> now, but we find it later in Twitter.
I also want to point that I have the privilege of able to change what you think about it in so only 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These <unk> are very <unk> unless I don't have to use them.
The worst part is going to happen to the head, because it is when they go to me, so I don't do anything while I read your head.
All right.
Why do I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it also <unk>
I've changed entirely what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, he had never had a <unk> in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I would put the back, and that <unk> the hair <unk>
Of course, except with surgery or a artificial belief like that I was done two days for work, there are very little than we can do to transform our way, which, even though the surface and <unk> has a huge impact in our lives.
So today, for me, to be obvious, it means to be honest.
I'm in this stage because I am model here.
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white, and in my website, and in my website, that's being a <unk>
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a <unk>
The first question is, how is it going to be a tool.
And I always say, a <unk> I was discovered, but it doesn't mean anything.
The real reason that I did a model is because he won the <unk> and I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what is this <unk>
Well, in the last centuries we haven't defined the beauty like health, and we came and tradition, which we're <unk> for <unk> we also have been associated with a high and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> and the white skin.
And that is my <unk> <unk> that I've been known to make money.
And I know there are people in the public who now shows <unk> and maybe there was some <unk> of the fashion <unk> which is <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> by knowing so much of models.
But sadly, I have to say that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York told all and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just just <unk> is that less than four percent, they were not <unk>
The next question that people always does is it is to be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know about that.
But then, what I really would say to each of these girls is: Why?
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> and <unk> which would be amazing, because they are the first one.
If after this list was <unk> but no, I want to be model, then I say, I know my <unk>
Because I am not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of <unk> magazine or the <unk> <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
How much you want to be a model is like to say that you want to win the writing when they be greater.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work that you can choose them.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years like model, because unlike the surgery <unk> can be <unk>
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have to take your studies, and you have a ceiling and a few jobs to your backs, no matter what you do, if you want to be <unk> that you want to be president of the United States, but you want to be president of the United States, the people will look <unk>
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, it's pretty much <unk> all the photos but that's just a little part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my time.
I know we're entering the personal ground, but it was a girl.
And so I used to my grandmother a few months ago.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came to me.
Here I'm in a <unk> party a few days before the pictures for the <unk>
Here I am with my team and a <unk>
And this is myself today.
And I hope that I am not myself in those photos.
They're <unk> of a group of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always makes me is: <unk> things.
I have too many <unk> for 20 inches and they never use, except a couple of it, but the privilege that I get in the real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me a <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was growing with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he was jumped on a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a <unk> agent to get <unk>
<unk> of these privilege for my name -- not why I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect of who they are.
I live in New York, and last year of the <unk> teenagers who were married and <unk> and <unk> and most of them, and most of them were young men young men.
And only there are <unk> young black young black and <unk> in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
But in how many times I get <unk> and <unk>
In order for this talk, I found that there was 53 percent of 13 years in the United States in the United States don't like their body, and that number it comes to <unk>
So the last question that people do is is: How is the life of a role model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little bit more thin and you have the most brilliant hair and you have the most happy hair and I could.
And behind the cameras, we give a answer that maybe the <unk>
<unk> is really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people and <unk>
And all of this is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we would never say in front of the cameras, what I've never told in front of them, I am insecure.
And I am because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask you with a little <unk> legs and the most brilliant legs and the more brilliant to be more <unk>
They only have to do with a group of models, because they have the most brilliant legs and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> women on the planet.
But above all it was hard to do a situation of <unk> education, and gender when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something that would keep in this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the image of the image that we have for success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since it was the greatest enough to run a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't know that the <unk>
There was no <unk> <unk> and no chance to do the photos -- not even a high care of the atmosphere.
In fact, most of the <unk> of <unk>
My story starts when, in the city of New York to give a <unk> my wife took me this photo holding my daughter in the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of the <unk> and the <unk>
He gave the fact that we went back to New York City, just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When I was born, the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said, why don't you take you to <unk> to New York in a <unk> journey.
Here is when we started to ask the hut that was going to be done to us that we are going to be in the photo of us who are going to be done with us in the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture to deliver the camera to a complete <unk> is so cause.
No nobody has been alive and luckily, never no one has <unk>
So we were not aware of how much of us change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter who had happened that day that a girl of five years, I could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a serious time or a specific journey.
They are also a way to stop time in a week of October and in order to think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only just the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because even though we took the same picture, our <unk> <unk> my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through their eyes and how it meets and interact with everything.
That time in particular, we go together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of the people, we were saving when a sudden, he was coming up in the leg, and a red <unk> of the <unk> store that <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
And he described to me what I had sense at five years of foot on that same place.
<unk> his heart <unk> with the force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what it looks in in New York -- because it's <unk> in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we created is <unk>
So, I want to share the idea of being <unk> in the conscious creation of <unk>
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go in a lot of the family.
I am always the one that you get the picture.
Now I want to show you all in the picture, and they didn't have to go back to somebody and <unk> and you get a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to tell you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the <unk> <unk>
First of all, why do you have so bad <unk>
It also has been associated with Disney <unk> like characters, <unk> <unk>
More recently, if you've been following the press, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> these are the attributes that would be <unk>
I don't know. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment --  <unk> not help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two kinds of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World War that are involved in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> War, where we have 16 species.
So why are the <unk> are important? First of all, provide political services.
They're our <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria. They will absorb the <unk> which is not going to be for them, and they had large losses losses and diseases in other animals.
Great recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the people, take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge <unk> in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge importance of <unk>
They've been associated with the old culture of <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the computer, and the afterlife, and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the United States in Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and he turned his life to save the <unk> <unk> the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In the culture of <unk> are actually a very important thing to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go open in places like this, there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural brain.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are in the ultimate end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they are being done, is because there are conflict between humans and <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, <unk> are victims of this.
In the South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical list of 2030, which means that at least 10 or 15 years old, and the reason is because they have been treated with a drug <unk> like the <unk>
This drug has been able to use them, in India.
Because there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> and when you have the dogs dogs -- has a huge car <unk> for <unk> The number of project has moved enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest parks in <unk> <unk> <unk> are going to be above the Lake <unk>
I'm not on the energy control, but we have to work with governments, because the wind flies do this to the birds. They cut it in half.
They're <unk>
In sub-Saharan Africa, there are a horrible <unk> <unk> to serve the <unk> and the market market.
So what is it doing? Okay, we're doing these birds. We're <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic behavior and see where they go.
We can see that they go through different countries, so you focus in a regular problem -- it's not going to serve about anything.
We have to work with governments in the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about the <unk> on the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that are <unk>
How can we decode it can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to his government and tell you to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go from this room, I would tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that it changed to opinion because he saw it to fly without <unk> without <unk>
Kenya, this world, will be a lot more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and all that I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> but I didn't feel about it,  I worked in Princeton, Kenya, Costa Costa <unk> and 1968, in early projects with African countries.
I worked for a <unk> <unk> and every project we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> on the 21st percent, we were good people and we were doing a good work in Africa.
Instead of that, all of the thing we do is <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a few, we decided to teach people to grow food.
So we have to have a <unk> <unk> to the South <unk> to this absolutely amazing Valley that comes into the <unk> River and we taught the local to grow tomatoes and <unk>
Of course, the people were not all in all interested in doing that, by what they would do, to come to work, and sometimes they don't do --  We were going to be <unk>  We were going to be able to be able to have agriculture.
However, instead of ask you how it was possible to do that, we just said, thank God that we are here --  <unk> time to save the people in the <unk>
And of course, all in Africa was <unk>
We have these <unk> <unk> in Italy, a <unk> would be used to this size. It's going to this size.
And we didn't think we were saying we were saying to the <unk> look, what easy is the <unk>
When the tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red at the morning about 200 <unk> came from the river and they ate everything.  And we said to <unk> "My God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, why we don't have agriculture here,  "Why don't you do it, they have never <unk>
And then I thought we just heard of them, <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, what they were doing -- and then they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project and then to see what they were doing, and then they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project.
Because as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that you are <unk> to the <unk> of Africa.
He wants to read a book, I read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book went in 2009.
We, developing countries, we have introduced to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I don't tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read his book.
<unk> in part of a woman, the damage we have done.
The West are <unk> <unk> <unk> and we tried people just two things: or the <unk> or we are <unk>
The two words come from the root <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
Yet two different things.
<unk> I try any of a different culture as if they were my kids, "Do you want to be a second.
I try to all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So the white in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a <unk> in the face -- "The little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all of economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This is the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman opened this conference put a <unk> on the soil and said, we can do -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to start 27 years to people, and invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never wanted anything, you have ever done to anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion -- the <unk> of the local passion who have sleep to become a better person.
So, what does you want to be <unk>
I would never have a community with a idea, and they sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We put it on a coffee. We put it on a <unk>
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We put in friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give a sense to anybody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do this?
The passion that she has for their own growth is the most important.
The passion that that man has for their own personal growth is the most important.
And then we help you find knowledge because no one in the world can have success alone.
The person with the idea can not have knowledge but knowledge is available.
So years and years and years ago, I had this idea: Why don't we have to get to a community to tell people what to do, why thank you why no, because of one time, you get <unk> but not in <unk>
I'll tell you a secret.
There are a problem with <unk>
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they would never say, in a public meeting what they want to do with your own money, what opportunity have been dead.
So the planning has this <unk> point.
In the most smart people from their community, you don't even even know the question -- because they didn't know their public programs.
What do we do? We do -- and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
You should create a new business.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the medical doctor of the business, which has moved with you in his home, in the table of his kitchen, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of a set of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot
I started this as a proof in <unk> city in West America.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get out of this <unk> <unk> where we came to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do, and I said, "I did something very, very hard.
I would be <unk> and you know, the government says, <unk> <unk>  We have done in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped us start 40 business.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of <unk>
Peter <unk> one of the most <unk> <unk> of the story, passed up to a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor professor before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a economy of company.
The planning is the death of the human <unk>
So now we have <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn to do that these people are going to talk to you.
You have to be able to be able to be <unk> privacy, has to be a fantastic to the <unk> and then we were able to come back in mass.
In a community of 10 people, we get 200 clients.
You can imagine a community of 400 people, intelligence and <unk>
What can you show you have been <unk>
People <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So, what I say is that the <unk> spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossils -- fossils -- and a moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
<unk> engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to think about is how <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for the <unk> revolution.
The <unk> <unk>
It'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There are an amazing story that was in a gay magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> was brought this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City not exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population has continued to be growing up to the <unk> of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million <unk> and the <unk> produced for six million horses and the <unk> produced for six million horsepower as it would be impossible to see.
They were already <unk> in <unk>  so in <unk> they were <unk> this fantastic technology that <unk> life in New York.
So, what does it happen? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States came up with <unk> companies <unk> <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very busy <unk> factories in <unk>
<unk> First, Henry years."
However, there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to be <unk>
So we don't go to talk to you.
Then, you have to give a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then you have to tell you the truth with <unk>
The smaller company, the largest company, it has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic -- you have to be fantastic -- you have to say with a fantastic <unk> and you have to count with a fantastic <unk>
Do you know what?
I've never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and look at the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This was still not born.
We've tested and looked at the 100 companies in the world -- <unk> <unk> all the new companies, Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all companies companies in the world have in common, just -- none of a single person.
I didn't have the word -- but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it started.
Nobody starts a single company.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a little business environment <unk> in <unk> alongside their early <unk> who will be done for you, what somebody did for this gentleman who talk about -- somebody who would ask you, what would you do?"
What can you do this? Can you do it?
Well, you can be able to look at the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do a <unk> <unk> that I looked at <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those who are all around us, you can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't think about a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space with simple tools like <unk> and feature.
These projects came from questions like, how much paid my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and ask to <unk> more things without calling the door in a <unk>
How to share more memories from our family buildings and understand better our <unk>
How to share more our hopes to the stores to the goods to our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm love in New <unk>
My soul has always been <unk> with the giant <unk> that provide <unk> and <unk> from a few centuries and I trust a city in a city.
It always gives the music.  There is a <unk> in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful <unk> of the world, but also one of the most different properties of America.
I live near this house and thought it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
his death was sudden and we lived it.
I thought a lot of death and death.
And this was a deep gratitude for time lived and in the time.
He gave it to the most significant things of my current life.
But <unk> by keeping this look at my daily life.
I think it's easy to be able to be able to be able to be able to catch up the day and to forget the really important for you.
So with the old aid and new friends became the wall of this <unk> house in a giant board and I wrote about her phrases for <unk> <unk>
So, the <unk> could take a <unk> to think about their lives and sharing stories in public space.
I didn't know what wait of this experiment but the next day the wall was <unk> and I was still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote in the wall.
<unk> I want to be <unk>  <unk> <unk> I want to sit to <unk> on the line of <unk>
<unk> I want to sing for millions of people.
I want to put a <unk>
I want to live outside of the <unk>
I want to be able to be able to be <unk>
I want to go to the <unk> <unk>
I want to be completely <unk>
This <unk> space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people did me ask me to <unk> and they gave me some difficult times.
It's about knowing that you are not going to be alone. It's about understanding our neighbors of new ways and <unk> is about giving the idea and the <unk> and to remember what is the most important for us to us and <unk>
This happened last year and I started to have hundreds of messages of people who wanted to do a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues in the modern center we did a <unk> and now they've been done walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Australia, Argentina and more there.
Together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express them and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of <unk> that is more important to ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever done to find the ways to get the perspective and remember that life is brief and <unk>
And the death is something that we're often trying to talk about or even thinking, but I understood that to convince the death is one of those things that are <unk> more power.
Think about the death of our life.
Our shared spaces can be better as individuals and like community and more media to share hope, fears and stories, people who surrounds us not only help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now I have a single <unk>
Please don't say I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce to my <unk>
<unk> has 22 years, it's high and very <unk>
I don't know, but it is <unk> so better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> <unk> will happen to what's going on.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences and notice in this:
When I started songs of our childhood, trying to tell you words that I don't even even know about one thing: I just know about the mind and the wonderful thing that it must be the gay thing.
Samuel has 16 years old. It's a very <unk>
<unk> memory <unk>
However, it's a memory story.
It doesn't remember if I forgot my <unk> but remind me the year that he came up with each of the songs of my hands -- conversations that we had when I was four years ago, they would have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be at my arm for the first episode of the <unk> and
It doesn't seem to me.
But most people are not <unk>
And, in fact, because their minds don't fit to the concept of <unk> often are often <unk> and <unk>
But what drives my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although we don't think about the <unk> that just could mean one thing: which was <unk> <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex cerebral disorder that affects social communication and sometimes to traditional skills.
In each individual is <unk> in a different way that <unk> is so different.
And in all the world, every 20 minutes, a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the business disorders.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I had just three years ago when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new being in my life.
When I was a few months ago, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies and actually didn't seem very interested in myself at all.
<unk> and <unk> in their own world, with their own rules, and it was pleasure in the smaller things like put cars around the room, looking around the room and eat any thing that would have between <unk>
As I grew up and I grew up more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> frustration and the <unk> <unk> had something really <unk> a pure nature, a kid that looked at the world without <unk> an human being never <unk>

I can't deny that there has been a very difficult moments in my family, moments in which I would have to think that they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about the <unk> communication and love, and I realize that they're things that you don't want to change the normal.
<unk> is about the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> a single thing to <unk> and then I would see that you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, <unk> or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> each of us has a gift in its interior and, honestly, the search of the <unk> is the last <unk> of the potential.
The chance to do the progress and change in the time we try to be like the others.
So I don't say I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I created a little bit of what it must have been <unk> in the country of the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a professor teacher who was going to give up a kind of communication to medical students.
I was afraid.  <unk> <unk> of these students with their big minds, their big books and their big and <unk> words.
But at the end of those conversations, I felt what <unk> had to have sense when they fell through the black hole and saw the door of a new world.
And so I felt when I had those conversations with students -- my ideas that they lost and wanted other experience also this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We need a huge communication communication communication and engineers to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our largest challenges from energy to the environment between each other, and if we don't know how to understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility like not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations are not going to happen if our scientists and engineers are not listening to see its wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please do with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how to make sure that you can do to make sure that their science is impossible. And that their engineering is <unk>
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
They don't tell us that study <unk> but study the <unk> that are the structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing their science, care with the <unk>
The exhibition is a <unk> for our understanding of their ideas.
You can say, <unk> and <unk> but why don't say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing that they do do that.
The contrary, as Einstein, as Einstein, which is all as simple, as it is possible, but not simple.
You can communicate it clearly their science without <unk> ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies are ways and <unk> with his content.
And to present his job, forget of the signs of <unk>
You have asked why they call <unk>  What do you do <unk> The <unk> <unk> and <unk>
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it gets too much in the area of our brain language and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> of example of <unk> Brown is much more effective shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that actually inspired the only one of the <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple sentence that the public can understand if you loses a little bit, and then provide graphics to <unk> our other senses and you think a deeper sense of understanding what they are going on.
I think these are just some key to help the other open the door and see the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've got this equation, all of the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all of the Moore's <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was a <unk> editor of the 19th century, which was a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that you look for a public charge or no matter -- and that, when you cut it through the <unk> use of a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I have no idea of what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that the words are the basis of politics, and all of the politicians know that they have to try to master the language.
It was not <unk> for instance, <unk> that Dr. Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the words that they said in the <unk>
And all of this was because of a guy with the <unk> name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
He took it on the <unk> of London and <unk> but he had enough people to deal with them, and at the end of the end had a popular support in London that I could.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most thinks it's <unk>
It's not. It's for a supply of the freedom of expression.
But to show you really how the words and political policy, I want to go back to the United States, just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you look at the leader of a <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They introduced all kinds of suggestions that could be <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and each other, <unk> <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the United States, <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about <unk>
And not even with it was <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen by a <unk>
And I could have <unk>
All the world was <unk> <unk> because this debate is <unk> for three weeks.
So the day of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the <unk> House was in the <unk>
The <unk> House didn't want to Washington, <unk>
She didn't want to call it King because he was going to give him to him or their <unk>
So he wanted to give the <unk> <unk> more <unk> and more <unk> that you would be.
And that title was <unk>
You didn't know the title. There was already before, but it only meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a bird.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it really was a <unk>
And that's why the British <unk>
They said, "Wow, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and <unk> with <unk> <unk>
"And who would take it with a <unk> <unk> and <unk> as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of argument the British <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite thing to where I've been able to figure out the shark has never <unk> the <unk> <unk>
President Barack Obama has lucky enough to keep there, waiting to the United States between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to get to <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most importantly, and this is the most importantly, and I want to <unk> is that the title of President of the United States doesn't sound at all.
Over all if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads at <unk> the largest economy of the world and a half of commercial vehicles and so on.
The reality, and the story have cooled to the <unk> <unk>
So at the end he won the <unk>
They got his <unk> <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a <unk> for the time.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has five nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate won and the <unk> <unk> because no one is going to be able to be able to say that now is the president of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to do a <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to give and control the reality, but actually actually change much more the words that these guys could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under the ground in an illegal mine of Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel like the <unk> bodies in the darkness, but I can't see a lot of more.
I hear voices that talk about but about all, that <unk> <unk> and rocks <unk> with <unk> tools.
As the others, I carry a cheap <unk> of light <unk> <unk> to the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> <unk> that keep the walls of that hole from a meter that took hundreds of meters on the earth.
It was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met days before, who had lost control and fell in that <unk>
When I talk to you today, these men are in the profound of that hole to put their lives without pay or reward and often, dying.
I walked from that hole and I went home, but they might never be <unk> because they're <unk>
In the last 28 years, I was creating green cultures in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> in the <unk>
Among all the incredible people that I met there was to a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO that has been involved to eradicating modern patients.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started to learn about slavery because he knew that there was in the world but not to 25 grade.
When we ended up to talk to me, I was very <unk> I was <unk> to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know how many people don't know?
He made me a <unk> <unk> and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and give my help.
So I started my journey to modern sharks.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
A few of the thought my second home.
But this time, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of African Africans during the whole thing about <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer -- was about three times the average American officer.
The equivalent of a few of us 50 years ago.
However, now you can prioritize families by generations for <unk> <unk>
Forget the slavery created <unk> of more than 13 millions of the year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with <unk> <unk> and better work to try to figure out that they are forced to work without <unk> under the threat of violence and cannot escape.
Now today, the sex works in the <unk> the goods produced by <unk> they have value, but they produce these are <unk>
<unk> exists in almost all the world and, yet, it's illegal around the world.
In India and vulnerable, I met <unk>
So this strange <unk> and it was like to go to the old Egypt or <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of <unk> C, men, women, in fact, young families in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in their head, until 18 to the time, and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
<unk> by the <unk> and the <unk> work in silence, doing this task and again for 16  17 hours a day.
There was no conversation to eat them, no to drink, and the <unk> <unk> I made it very <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the powder that my camera became too hot to the way and left them to work.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better than these people.
On the <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was going quickly to me and he took me and he said, "I don't do it. You don't do it.
And he explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I could not be able to be able to be successful.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not saving that country.
I could put them in a worst situation, worse than they were.
I had to trust <unk> the <unk> and to work inside the system for their liberation and it would be <unk>
In terms of me, tried to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the end, I found kids <unk> rocks over miles to trucks that they hoped to go down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who had load and children and children put them into their heads with <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's hard to see something as <unk>
How can we influence something as <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're <unk> and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They don't have anything to do it.
When these chief <unk> their freedom, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
When you hear the word that they often think about sex traffic and because of this global consciousness to me that would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> <unk> women who had been <unk> <unk>
It led to me for a few Ford <unk> that gave this basement <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the brand, they are local for <unk>
They have weird rooms, small rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and kids, some of that only seven years ago, they're forced to come to clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted in the wall and it divided by a <unk> and a <unk>
The workers often suffer by sex to hands of their clients.
On the <unk> I remember having a sense of <unk> <unk> and in that moment, I could barely imagine what it should be <unk> in that <unk>
I just had a <unk> the stairs where they <unk>
There was no <unk> doors.
There was no windows enough enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and because we can play a very difficult, is important to point that the <unk> even the sex traffic comes around us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture in <unk> in the domestic service and the list can be going on.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300 children are sold every year like <unk>
This is everywhere -- but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often connect with the <unk>
I went to recent villages in which there was very early families in the trade of the <unk>
This is a family.
The hands of black hands are from the father, the blue <unk> and in red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these large barrels and the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My <unk> told me their stories.
"We don't have <unk>
It would be able to be able to get out of this house and go to another place where we really have to make our job."
It estimates that there are more from 4,000 children <unk> in the lake -- the largest artificial lake of the world.
When we came back, I was going to put a quick back.
I saw what seemed to be a <unk> family in a boat, two younger brothers -- some younger children have sense there?
<unk> were all together.
The children are separated from their <unk> families and forced to work <unk> <unk> in the lake, despite not know a <unk>
This kid has eight years.
When our boat came up with it -- I was <unk> I was <unk> I was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of the water.
The <unk> branches out of the water trees in the lake <unk> we often provide networks and children, and with fear, and with fear, and the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it has always been forced to work on the lake.
By fear of her love to get and like the whole life has been treated with <unk> <unk> is to the most young clients under their own.
I met these kids at five of the morning, when you get the last networks, but they had been working from the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of a
<unk> and <unk>
And it would be able to point out that these networks are getting over 400 pounds when they are <unk>
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was agreement in a <unk> village <unk>
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> to victims of <unk>
Kofi Is it possible.
Who will get to be because somebody decided to make the difference in their life?
<unk> for a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a <unk> <unk> with his bandwidth and the window.
We asked us to do it for a way to the <unk>
At the end of the way, we were going to go out of the car, and he asked it to the driver that you get quickly.
And then you can end this path and he said, "This is the way, this is the <unk>
As we started back, we took the <unk> <unk> the path and after walking close to a hour we found that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the team of pictures of my head to as you put in these water to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had in front of a city of holes that could fit in a <unk> field and all of them were filled with <unk> workers.
A lot of women had kids come into their hands -- and as we were looking forward <unk> <unk> in <unk>
<unk> uses in the process of <unk>
These <unk> are <unk> in a <unk>
When they came out of the <unk> they were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember he looked at their eyes, Professor <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have to 90 feet and these people have <unk> <unk> and then they will be transported to another area in which we would put the stone to extract the gold.
By the first point, the site seems like to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to the side of the side we see to work to other lucky and also children.
They are all victims of <unk> disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ends up like this victim of <unk> and <unk> for <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When he died his father his father took it to work with him in the mines.
When I die his uncle, <unk> I was the debt of the uncle who will be <unk> in the mines.
When I met him, I had worked in the <unk> 14 years and the <unk> of the leg that you see here is a product of a accident.
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and yet, that's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Even this, he was going to be released and <unk> with help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this kind of <unk> of the face of a <unk> which was inspired to me.
I want to throw light on the <unk>
Did you know that their images would be seen for you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we will be able to reach out of them, and we will do everything possible to help change their lives.
I think if we can see a few other as human beings, then it makes very difficult to tolerate apples like the <unk>
These images are not <unk> are of people, religious people like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no one day that I think I don't think about these so many people beautiful, <unk> that I've had the great honor to do.
I hope these images will hear a force in who you see, in people like you, and I hope that that force turn a fire and that fire <unk> light on religion -- because, without that light, the <unk> of slavery can continue living in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make mathematical mathematics and there's a peculiar problem for who the <unk> are like the <unk>
Nobody knows what the hell do we do.
So today, we're going to try to tell you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activities of the most humans.
We had <unk> <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  we're going to see more forward.
But the connectome is a beautiful degree of extraordinary training a high level of skill, and probably a certain artistic <unk> can have a genetic component of it.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders. As the bad of Parkinson's disease will put this extraordinary ability to my friend <unk> <unk> that in his time was a <unk> <unk>
In the last years, it has made a lot of a lot in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world that are <unk> and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in a objective way, and ultimately, the only way we know if you actually have a cure to be when we have a objective or a <unk> and <unk>
But it is <unk> that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement, and so they don't form blood analysis and the best thing we have is a <unk> test.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of the clinical trials, you never do.
And what if patients could do it in house?
That would save a journey to the clinic. What if patients could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
They don't have to have a personal thing.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars.
So what I want to be <unk> as a really conventional way to do, you see, in some sense at least, we all are <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration <unk>
It shows somebody healthy while it makes sound sound to talk about it, we can imagine as a <unk> <unk> because we have to coordinate all those individual organs to produce sounds and all we have the genes -- for example.
And, as the <unk> requires a extraordinary.
Let's think the time it brings a kid to learn to talk.
From the sound, we can track the position of the ropes as <unk> and so like Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk>
In the acquisition of <unk> you can see an example of <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
So the speech becomes more <unk> and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these forms based on the voice with clinical trials -- so they're both <unk>
<unk> test is not <unk> both use modern infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals for it.
Both of them are <unk> OK, but also the shapes based on voice are not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They are very low and we all know what happens.
When something takes a <unk> cost it looks at mass scale.
These are a few incredible goals to get in.
We can reduce the <unk> <unk>
They wouldn't have to go to the clinic in the <unk>
With <unk> <unk> we could get data.
We could make it massive <unk> in the cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk>
We have the chance to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So to give you the first steps in that sense, we're out of the <unk> <unk> of the disease.
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to tackle these goals.
We have local lines for about 85 million people in the world.
<unk> or no disease can call under price and to leave a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached the percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom <unk> <unk> all these samples -- let's say who is healthy and who not?
What do you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yes. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. TR: Sure.
<unk> You see, some people can be <unk> it can not be <unk>
But we're going to get a very big sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and they do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the factors of confusion in looking for the real markers of the disease.
TR: They have an accuracy <unk> at this time?
<unk> lots more than that.
Actually, my graduate student -- I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic work and now has shown that it works in the mobile network -- also, what you do, the project. Now we have an precision.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a <unk>
<unk>
TR: Thank you very much. <unk> public <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before 9/11, I made <unk> <unk> in New York.
We are <unk> creatures.
It would be <unk> in the darkness, and there are no windows and by general -- we will replace the solar light.
We do the <unk> models -- even more <unk> the perfect skin skin, even more perfect we do it, possible and <unk> in the press all time but some of us are really artists with a lot of years, but some of us are really artists with a lot of years, but some of us are actually artists and the photograph.
The 11 of September 2011, I saw from my home, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that came into Japan.
Up time later, a organization where it was <unk> -- <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the <unk> team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay in home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13 of May traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village in the <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the <unk>
The level of clean water has gone up over 24 and more than three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> rubble from the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the <unk> and we left the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish dead <unk> of the local factory.
We were <unk> and they love it.
For weeks for weeks as much as the neighbors found things.
They found pictures of pictures and cameras and cameras and <unk>
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places of the villages of around <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures that these pictures are that that these people who had a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
When they were born from the <unk> and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help them in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean the files -- the large, giant <unk>
This place it turned to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And there were used and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and <unk> I had heard of the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until the top I was my memory that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years ago, some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't help help think like <unk> how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that night I went in Facebook <unk> with some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too much <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had <unk> and <unk>
In a way, that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be so tragic as to have the photo of <unk>
With the time of the time, they came through some more pictures and they had more <unk> and that's that I went back to Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people in 12 countries were offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people <unk>
In Japan, in 80,000 to <unk> <unk> a village to <unk> <unk>
One time at the week we use our scanner in modern libraries that had <unk> where people were going to recover their photos.
So the time we <unk> in <unk> is a different story about the <unk> of the photos.
I could run an hour. It was a few weeks old.
It was a few months old.
This <unk> had to draw virtually hand using the <unk> and the areas and detail the water had no <unk>
I took a long time.
The water is destroyed all these pictures of <unk> of bacteria, covered from bacteria, with obesity, even with oil, even with the step of the time I continue to be <unk> for that to be a important part of the project.
We couldn't do the photo unless it was <unk> <unk> and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We had lucky <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to hurt even more the pictures already <unk>
As once he said, <unk> the leader of my group is like to do a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures had kind of kind of <unk>
He had started <unk> she was going to realize that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of his husband and their own face would not have been able to <unk> the images in a single photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When they picked their pictures a little bit of his story with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble station between the rubble station of where she used to be his home, but their colleagues <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the <unk> to close the barriers to the <unk>
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their young kids, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was stuck in the water.
He took a week to find his entire family and know that they all had a day.
The day that I paid their pictures his <unk> son was 14 years old.
For that, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could come back to look at -- something I could remember from the past who would not have been written by that day of reading when everything in his life changed or it was <unk>
After six months in Japan <unk> families had joined there -- hundreds of them helped us clean up to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- the great majority became the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers from all the world helped us to go to 90 families hundreds of pictures and <unk>
For this time, we actually don't spend more than a 1,000 time and materials, most of them in ink for <unk>
We took pictures all the same one.
One photo is a remember of somebody or something, a place, a relationship, somebody wanted.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we could take us but the first thing that we would go to try to look at it.
This was about the project, to restore little bits of humanity, to bring somebody his connection with the past.
When a picture like this is a little bit of a huge difference in the life of the person that the <unk>
This is also a great difference in the life of the <unk>
A few of them will be connected with something bigger to put something, using their talent for something that are not models to be <unk>
To end up I'd like to read this email email that I went back from Japan after six months.
When I was able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
One particular picture with women in different age from the grandmother to the small girl came up with a baby, I was <unk> because a picture of my family my family -- my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, and my <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the world in all the few of our basic needs.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> was inspired to me, and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that comes up a apple in a exhibition of just one of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and seeing the world not to a million or a thousand million, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can create videos in the lower camera on light.
And so we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing inside of the body without using X-ray and challenge actually the <unk>
If I take a laser <unk> and I put it up and <unk> in a second <unk> and I mean, in a second of <unk> creating a package of <unk>
And so that <unk> <unk> to travel to the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet does.
So if we took that bullet and this package and <unk> in this bottle, How do you fall out of this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this is --  remember, all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times faster, so you can see light on movement.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what is going on.
<unk> our <unk> comes into the bottle with a <unk> package that starts <unk> and that inside, it starts <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> is going to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the fishermen finally get to the table, and then they explode in a few directions.
As you can see, there's a <unk> bubble.
In that time, the waves are coming through the table and because of the top of the top of the upper part of the bottle, after a few two: that the <unk> <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and we do it and we do it on the same distance and we see it on the camera to about 10 billion times -- how much they think that we would take us to see that thought.
A day? A week. Actually, all a year.
It would be a very boring movie --  from a slow <unk>
And what do we test with nature <unk>
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table, and the wall of the background.
It's like <unk> a <unk> in a pond.
It's the way that nature shows a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes you see a <unk>
But if you look at a more more and more that you can realize that, as the light is <unk> <unk> <unk>
Why? Because the <unk> is <unk> and the light moves into its interior and it comes back to go out of a lot of <unk>
In the future, when this <unk> is in their cell -- they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is <unk> without having to do it.
So why do we create this camera in Cairo.
As <unk> you know, if we take a photo to the <unk> it goes very little light, it goes very little light.
But we're going to be a billion times faster than the <unk> <unk> so we just get a lot of light.
We did that <unk> that <unk> <unk> million times, and again and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> of data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> I showed you.
We can take all of those data data and <unk>
They can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would be able to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw something from light on the door. <unk> go to the room, a part is going to meet the door, and from there to the camera,
What we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We've already built it.
The left, is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
And then after the dawn of our article in Nature <unk>
And a little fraction of the <unk> go back to the camera but interestingly, in a little different moments here.
And as we have a camera that works how fast our <unk> has <unk>
It has very good <unk> and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distance to the door and also to the <unk> objects but we don't know what a distance.
At the project a laser can record a picture of <unk> that you see on the screen, you really don't have a sense, it doesn't have any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, tens of images, the <unk> and we will try to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object.
We can see it in <unk>
This is our <unk>
We have things to explore before we put this out of the laboratory, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> <unk> which is going on the back of the curve, and it's going on the back of the curve, and it's going to go back from the curve, and it comes back to the curve, in the <unk>
Or we could look for survivors in the dangerous conditions looking at the light of the window windows for the windows services.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body and <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue, and the blood is pretty difficult, so that actually is a asked to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new measure of visualization to solve the problems of critical health problems.
So as <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, a scientist, became a art, a art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> data that we collect each time are not only just for a scientist, but we can can we can can we can be able to reconstruct but we can can we can be able to imagine.
We create a new way of photography with <unk> and <unk>
And let's look at those <unk> remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk>
But here's something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are getting from us.
The waves should move into us.
What does it happen?
It turns out, as we are recording almost the speed of the light, we have strange effects to the Einstein would have to love this image.
The order to happen in the events in the world sometimes you see at the camera at the camera.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's already time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A cell can <unk> life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile cell a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone can give a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell can record a song, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
All of this is possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a <unk> <unk> and living in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to look at a change.
This is the <unk> <unk> if all these people had been able to be able to be <unk> in search of a change, they have a phone in your pocket.
Who is a cell here?
<unk>
Raise their phones, <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a lot. We almost have a mobile phone.
But today, to talk about me, from my mobile phone, and what changed my life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> lines of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. wrote a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This means he says that every telephone company, the Internet of all Europe, has to store a wide range of data from the <unk>
Who is called <unk> who sent a email to who.
Who is sent to a text <unk>
And if we use the phone, where we are.
All this information is stored at least six months -- and to two years ago in his telephone company, or their <unk>
And in all Europe and they said, "We don't want this."
They said, they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital era and we don't want the phone and the creators of the Internet, all this information about us.
There was <unk> "I find all they said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10 thousand people who came to the streets of Berlin, and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of the even said that this would be <unk>
The <unk> was the secret police police <unk>
And I also asked me if this works.
They can store all this information about us?
Every time we use the <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> that in that time, was the largest telephone company in Germany, which is why I was <unk> all the information that you have about me.
I asked her one time, and I went back to <unk> and I didn't have a certain response -- it was all of the <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we don't give you this information.
At the end of <unk>
<unk> the demand and they would send it the information that I was <unk>
Meanwhile, the Golden <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for the German law of the <unk>
So I got this ugly <unk> with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
<unk> and five thousand <unk>
At the beginning, and I said, well, it's a huge archive right. OK.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this bird.
It was a little bit <unk> what should you do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make a public <unk>
Because I want to show people what the <unk>
So next to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can go back and try to go back and forward.
You can see every step to you.
And you can see how I'm going to be <unk> in train to <unk> and what often I think about the way.
All of this is possible with this information.
That gives a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me about a couple times.
Then I call me some friends and they call it between them.
And then you call the other, and the other to the other, and we ended up with this huge network of communication.
You can see how their people are communicating to each other time to call each other to each other time to go in.
You can see all this.
You can see the Web of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the way of your society, because you know who you talk to who, who do you talk about who who would give you a email to whose all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is represented at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said to the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they have a <unk> in your pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who I did in this protest, and if the <unk> would have known who were the leaders, this would never have happened.
The one of the <unk> of <unk> might never have happened.
And, in a result, not the one of the <unk>
Because today, the cultural agencies and companies want to store so much information about us as possible inside and outside of the website.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to be <unk> forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital era is not a contradiction.
But today, you have to fight the <unk>
You have to fight for that in a day.
When you go back home to their friends who is a value of the 20th century, and it's not a year of fashion.
When you go home, <unk> to their realization that only because companies and capital agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask his company -- what information is <unk>
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to remind you that they have to fight the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hi "Where about?
It's not enough.
Hi "Where about?
I call me <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have a result, I have an brain for that <unk> all the time.
Take a look.
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And luckily, <unk>
<unk> Solly is not genetic
It's not <unk> no <unk>
No one of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were <unk> brothers, even though they are.
It's just about accidents, like the ones that happened to me.
Now, I'm going to be <unk> I'm not <unk>
They feel bad for me, because at some point of life, have to be <unk>
We're going to go back.
<unk> <unk> are in the center station in search of parking lot and what do you see?
16 places for <unk>
And I think, "God, I can be at least a little <unk>
In addition, I say, I have 99 problems, and the Solly Solly is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would put the gold <unk>
I am <unk> <unk> and I live in New Jersey.
If that doesn't be better, maybe you should do it.
I am from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same devices.
I also love that if I would like to walk from my house to New York, I would do it.
A lot of people with cerebral cerebral <unk> but my parents don't believe in the <unk>
The <unk> of my father was: "Can you do it -- <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> me.
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents <unk> to the school system, my parents <unk> to the school system, and if you didn't want to take all the wrong note in my mother.
My dad taught me to walk at the five years to put my <unk> in their feet and just to me.
Another approach that I used was to have was to have a dollar in front of me to do it.
The <unk> I carry inside was very strong and <unk>
Yes. The first day in the garden garden went as a <unk> <unk> which has received a lot of <unk>
When I had to grow, only had six Arab in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 percent, and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and that the political would be able to use <unk> to the <unk> as <unk>
People who grew up had no problems with my belief.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> a lot of hunger during the <unk>
And I told you that I had enough fat to live three months of <unk> so that <unk> from the dawn of this is very easy.
<unk> <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't pay the physical therapy -- so I sent to my school school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or what I can walk with <unk>
I am in New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I was too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer of summer in the coast of Jersey, I was not going to go in.
I spent my <unk> in a level of war, because my parents worried that if we don't go back to Palestine -- all the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the summer of the summer of the summer of the summer, I often have my father tried to <unk> so I was wearing <unk> and he would send it up to me in the <unk> <unk> and I remember the water -- and I remember the water and I remember <unk>
But the cure <unk> was the <unk>
I have to say that it's very boring, but before I could do it, was a <unk> <unk> that I couldn't put a <unk> <unk>
And now I can do it in your head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything that no dream was impossible and my dream was to be in the <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through the positive actors, and I got a scholarship for the <unk> University of the State State because it was going on all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> <unk>
All of me <unk>
I did all the tasks of the less smart, I took the short note in my school, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the <unk> <unk> my teachers <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called <unk> very slow on it.
It's a work of a girl with <unk>
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started <unk> the four <unk> <unk> end will have a <unk>
I have <unk>
At the end of the <unk> Al weekend.
Thank you my <unk> <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't have the paper.  They gave it to <unk> <unk>
I went to <unk> running the <unk> of the theater, crying historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, asking me why and she told me that because they believed that because they think I couldn't do the individual games.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the scenes of risk, it can't be <unk>
It was a role for the one that literally had been born and they gave it a <unk>
The university was <unk> my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors, no disability for <unk>
When I came back home, and my first <unk> <unk> was like extra in a <unk>
My dream became reality.
And I knew it would be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Instead, it was there as a <unk> I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the <unk> <unk> <unk> not <unk>
Just <unk> <unk>
But I had <unk>
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I did <unk>
In my first tour took <unk> famous from New York to New Jersey, and I never forget the face of the first <unk> that took when she was going to high speed by the New Jersey <unk> with a <unk> that had a <unk>
I worked in <unk> <unk> and also in Arab in the Middle East, and no <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that you never heard that little <unk> <unk> which says that women are not fun, and they are very fun.
In 2003, my brother other mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media media and the time to remind the girls' school <unk> and Arab are not <unk>
<unk> to the Arab was much more easy to fight the challenge of the <unk>
My great chance came in 2010.
I was like invited to the <unk> program. It has been back with Keith <unk>
I walked as if it was to a <unk> <unk> to a study and sat in a wheelchair and they sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the <unk> and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I joined the desk on the desk to get out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, was <unk>
At the end I had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they don't go to me.
But not just Mr. <unk> turned to <unk> but he was just like <unk> and I looked at my chair.
Something fun I learned in straight with Keith <unk> was that the people on the Internet are <unk>
It says that kids are <unk> but they never have <unk> of me no longer <unk>
Suddenly my disability on the Internet became a <unk> object.
<unk> clips in line with comments like, "Why do you start?
"It's <unk>
And my <unk> <unk> <unk>
How disease does it work?
We really should do it for it.
A triangle, suggested even my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Stars is as visual as the race.
If someone in a wheelchair you can't do a <unk> then you know, you can't make somebody in a wheelchair.
<unk> are <unk> Yeah, <unk> <unk>
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said that not <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, I have grown with the media of communication, I don't think about it.
I hope together we can create more valuable images of disability in the media and in modern life.
Maybe if there were more simple images -- that <unk> less hatred in the Internet.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led to me to have a very remarkable.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I came to act in a movie with Adam <unk> and to work with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world has become <unk>
I was <unk> in terms of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The <unk> <unk> a <unk> organization to give children refugees to kill a real way of what my parents <unk>
It was the only time that my father saw me act in live, and I'm doing this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can do, you can also can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a kid of a small people.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a little village to the South <unk>
This town is about <unk>
<unk> brings up to the small people and the edge of the <unk>
There was nothing for him there, it's going to the big town, in this case, <unk> the capital capital.
When it comes there, there is no opportunity, there are no work to work in the future.
He has just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After a year <unk> anything.
One day was about a guy who offers it to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
He meets a <unk> group of people, which gives you a <unk>
It gets a little bit of money so that you can buy new new money to send home to their family.
He showed a young one.
I finally go home.
It starts a new life.
It has an objective of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, the car car.
That kid of that little village with the dreams of the great city was the terrorist <unk> and that group of people were <unk> a cognitive organization with the Qaeda.
So, how do the story of a kid of a little village trying to support their dreams in the city ends up with him <unk>
He was waiting for me.
I was waiting for a chance, waiting to start their future, waiting for a perspective of future, and this was the first thing that you could.
This was the first thing that he took it from what we call it <unk>
And his story is across urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young countries who <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, which are looking at something beyond the <unk>
For young young people, the great dream of the town, the great dream of the opportunity to work, but young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the people who have been in the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people who live in cities will be under the cities of 18 years.
If we don't include young young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't have to be able to save the history of the <unk> of <unk> to violence, to the <unk> to be the story of cities of the cities.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young <unk>
70 percent, not going to school.
They don't do virtually anything.
I went back to <unk> last month and I went to visit the <unk> <unk> the hospital.
I remember to be at that hospital hospital to <unk> thinking, and if I never had it off.
And if I had seen forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to filter to a few leaders in a business <unk>
<unk> to a few of 90 leaders <unk>
We sat and we had a <unk> of ideas on the big challenges that face the city.
One of the young men in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
I had no job, no opportunities.
I remember when he said to me, which was because she was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was the perfect white phone for Al <unk> and other messages to be <unk>
They used people like it.
But this story takes a different way.
In <unk> the greatest resolution to get to the B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed completely the immune system, and a motorcycle can be the <unk>
<unk> saw a chance and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> to the local residents who don't normally have <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and their dream is at some point that hundreds of <unk> for the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this happen?
I think his ability to identify and take a new opportunity.
It's the <unk> spirit and I think the human spirit can be the most powerful tool against the <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who went to one of my <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> to train to a few of the young people in the bottom of the American initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of the business crisis.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has been seen in over 22 years, and it makes it recently, until it was recently, until 9/11, if you wanted a flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were using a plastic <unk>
If you get to someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the response to be <unk>
So, Juliano saw a opportunity.
He started a <unk> company, and design <unk>
I created a farm in the outside of <unk> and started to grow <unk> and <unk> that as he said, could survive the hard climate <unk>
And it started the <unk> of flowers to be able to create gardens in the houses, and the companies companies and now is working in the creation of the first public park, in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where young families, the young people, can go together, and like he says, smell <unk>
By the way, he doesn't be <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of birth, had a really deep impact in young people.
They had never thought to start a business.
They had thought to work for a <unk> working for government, but their story, their innovation, actually had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city like a place of opportunities.
The encouraged to believe that could be the <unk> that could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges that face the city.
<unk> solutions to local problems.
So, inspire the young people and creating a <unk> culture is really a great step, but the young people need capital to make their ideas.
They need experience and orientation to <unk> in development and put it on their business.
<unk> young people with the resources that you need to be <unk> the support that you need to move from understanding of the understanding of the creation, and create <unk> for economic growth.
For me, the human spirit is something to start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
It's not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Park and this is how it calls it when it is that it turns out the way people see their city.
<unk> led to the street to help rent to rent and keep the <unk> for it.
They gave them the chance to escape the <unk> of the <unk>
These young people are having a tremendous impact in their cities.
So my suggestion is to become young young men in <unk> and <unk> their innovation <unk> and you will have more stories about flowers and <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I had about 10 years and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains -- a <unk> area north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was doing that the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and it won't be the way that we had <unk> we can almost pretend that we were the first human beings in front of the earth.
It comes to our camp.
It was a <unk> <unk> with a beautiful lake <unk> when I discovered something terrible.
Behind the <unk> had a <unk> of about four meters with hearts hearts <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too <unk> as to get out of what they thought was going to clean their <unk>
That question remained with me, and you get a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter like <unk> or where <unk> <unk> who clean our junk <unk>
Who clean our junk in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
So here in New York, the Department of <unk> <unk> the <unk> of 11 metric tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and she walked through their legacy, and interviewed people in offices and facilities in all the town, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go more.
So I started working as <unk>
Now not just I did was not just in the trucks.
And there's the mechanical <unk> and <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing amazing thing.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as serious as you believe, and in the days that it is very strong you would be <unk>
It costs a lot of <unk>
I met people who had worked in this for several years, and their bodies continued to <unk> the weight of taking on their body tons all of the weeks.
It's also the danger.
I agree with the Bureau of <unk> <unk> the <unk> of waste is one of the ten <unk> of the country, and I learned right.
You're coming up and entering the traffic all day and they go around around you.
You just want to be able to be able to be <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's pretty bad for the <unk>
And also the junk itself is filled with a matter that often fall from the truck, and you have a terrible.
I also learned about <unk>
When you go out of the <unk> and you see a city from the next back of the truck, you get to understand that the junk is like a force of nature in yes.
It never gets to come.
It's also like a <unk> form or doors.
You always have to be on movement.
And it's also the stigma.
I think the stigma is particularly ironic because I think that the <unk> of waste are the most important work in the streets of town, for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the water waste and effective every day, this starts to <unk> from their <unk> and their <unk> <unk> <unk>
So we had controlled for decades and centuries to come back and start <unk>
The economy is needed.
If we can't get rid of the old -- we don't have a space for what the engines of the economy are starting to fail when it is in danger the consumption.
I'm not advocating by capitalism, I just put his relationship.
And then I call what I call our average speed of being necessary.
And so I mean by the speed of the time that we used to move in the time of the time.
They are often not <unk> or <unk> or we took with us our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our bottle of water.
We use, the <unk> we forgot about them, because we know that there's a job force on the other side of it.
So today, I want to show a couple ways to think about the design of waste that maybe can help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and humans.
Their job, I think, is almost <unk>
They are in the street every day.
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do us.
It's almost a <unk>
The flow that they keep giving us to each other, our own <unk> our own <unk> and that flow has always to remain a way or another.
One day after the September of September 2001, I heard the <unk> of a <unk> truck on the street, I took my little little little girl on the street, and I came up on the <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of <unk> <unk>
And I tried to thank you to do his work that day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and he said, "We're going to be fine.
We're going to be <unk>
Soon after that began to investigate the <unk> and I came back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together so many times and we did good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist in this planet as we exist in this planet as a species we have to include and have to realize all the cost, even the very real human cost of the hand.
The waste that we think when we talk about listening, represent three percent of the amount of waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next thing you see somebody whose work is clean the junk of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you.
My work focuses on the connection to think about our American life, making part of the environment where architecture is born of the conditions and traditions of local communities.
Today, I carry two recent projects like this.
Both projects are involved in countries, and the other in Tunisia.
In addition to the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become a part of the most essential part of the work of architecture.
The first example started with a invitation to design a <unk> center in the capital of Ethiopia, <unk> <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example to my team and to me, about what we had so on.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out of <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three major aspects for <unk>
In first, these buildings are almost <unk> because they have very large stores where people can't be able to be able to be able to buy things.
Second, you need to take a lot of energy because of the tsunami with mass generates in the top, so it's necessary a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it is about an climate climate that is 20 to 25 degrees for all the year.
And thirdly, his aspect has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a worth of a very rich place in culture, and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, was actually <unk> with the old market that is this structure to the air air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
This is also that idea of using the public space to produce <unk>
So I thought, that that was really what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building of several stories using these principles.
The next challenge was introduced to the situation, the website, which is <unk> in a very much growth area of town, where big part of the buildings that we now see in the image, not before.
And it's also among two streets parallel that you don't communicate in a hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, driving all the <unk> of the building.
And this spreads with a <unk> <unk> that creates a space to the <unk> building in the building that are <unk> by their own way, and the rain.
And around this space, we have built the idea of the market with little business, which changes in every floor, because of the way of space.
I also thought, how to close the <unk>
I wanted to find a solution to <unk> the local conditions.
And I started thinking in a similar fabric to a <unk> <unk> to allow the water on the air and also the light, but in a <unk>
Then we go back in these beautiful buttons of the <unk>
They have properties of quantum geometry and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> that are the windows that they leave the air and light of a way to the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little bits of colors that use the light inside the building to illuminate the building for night.
With these ideas it was not easy to convince the <unk> because he thought, "This is not a public center -- not what you are.
But in course we all realized that this idea of the market was actually to be much more worse than the commercial center of the commercial center because the end of the bank had more local to make it.
And also the idea of the <unk> was a lot more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air cells.
So we get certain savings savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the <unk> of energy for the building in a city where the electricity is just almost every day.
So we managed to get a great advantage to put <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the ceiling like a new public space with areas and bars that created this urban <unk>
And these <unk> in the roof, that in a set of water for <unk>
It's waiting for early early in the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the construction floor.
The second example is a <unk> plan and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a very large project, the biggest thing that I have to organize it, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, his tradition and culture.
So during that analysis I put special attention in the <unk> a structure of 1,000 years ago, which was surrounded by a wall with twelve doors.
When I went to all, the first operation, of design that we did was to expand the street streets, creating 12 basic blocks in size and features that there are everywhere and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some of the things in relation to the idea of the door to the idea of the <unk> doors.
And the last operation, was to think in the cell, the little cell cell in the project, like the apartment, as a part of the essential plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for a apartment in the climate change.
And it is <unk> because it creates a <unk> difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural selection.
So <unk> a framework that makes most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the solar plant we have all the connections for the <unk>
And it also responds to the local norms that they set up more density in the upper levels and a smaller density in the plant.
And they also find this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like <unk> the community in the construction community.
It's where all the neighbors, you can climb and <unk> and make activities such as a two miles per morning or come from a building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach.
And also, they're in developing countries, where you can see cities literally grow.
In these cities, the impact of architecture changes to communities and local economies at the same rate that grow buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have as an objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years ago, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had big <unk> <unk> and a little <unk> of <unk> <unk> was strong <unk> for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was filled with <unk> until I <unk> my <unk> plan.
One day, I was a time after the end of school was a little afternoon, and I woke up in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I went in the room in school, I took the table of my <unk> <unk>
And then I did.
<unk> my <unk> was just a little bit, just a little bit of it.
All of the way.  And to see the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So, in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of the <unk> and I just got a seat in order to be there, because it <unk>
I'm still excited about what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I would never tell me.
It's that everything was <unk>
I never <unk>
But especially of all, the reason that I worried about the reason that this little girl was so excited to be so good for <unk>
I was <unk>
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from it.
Also, the primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that the <unk> are the number of <unk> in the United States.
And, yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the <unk> or the long duration or the sadness.
So we have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab where you study the <unk> in all of their possible ways.
In fact, I don't know if it's a clear to say that if there was no <unk> <unk> would have no literature.
So I wouldn't have <unk> <unk> or <unk>
It wouldn't have king <unk> or <unk>
I wouldn't have <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
There is no <unk> I know that <unk> has the answers to all, and in terms of <unk> almost the ones has all.
This year has been 100 years of his work <unk> <unk> for the time <unk> the most <unk> study of the sex <unk> and also the <unk> all that we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details <unk> right?
We think about a kid trying to embrace the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot about the lasts that is that image.
We forgot about it that it is.
I mean, it's about books that Von <unk> said they were so <unk> like <unk>
I don't know what the <unk> <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
So let's see why they go as well together, the novel and <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the <unk> that you reduce the person, to their wish, the <unk> are a <unk> <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel when we feel at it.
When we feel <unk> we tell us a story.
One story about life of other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
It will be able to do, and audience, we know exactly what I'm going to <unk> <unk> to put the <unk> right?
The <unk> are going to have all <unk> <unk> and that's something that <unk> I understand.
All that she makes to give me pleasure -- could be pleasure to another, maybe right now.
And it starts to say that story, and since then, <unk> says that every lot of a little <unk> that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in their <unk>
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were <unk> <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a bad job.
<unk> are <unk>
It's a <unk> emotion -- there are <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
In the <unk> I like the big little <unk> and the nice little <unk> and small <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of the photos.
That's why it's so successful.  <unk> <unk> <unk> language <unk>
When you <unk> it is in his <unk> <unk> and it suddenly hear behind the doors and <unk> to the <unk> of his <unk> then they saw, those behaviors.
He says, "Look, do you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of a old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "This research research with real value <unk>
<unk> is trying to demonstrate that the <unk> you see <unk> and they do it seem to be <unk> but in their <unk> are search of knowledge, search of the truth, a real truth -- in fact, what to <unk> <unk> the hardest way.
The pain, the <unk> -- these were the right to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to figure out that you need to be done in us a range of feelings -- a lot more profound and vital that a wise man that can be <unk>
We're saying that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> will affect ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this way as a brilliant way.
There are some other emotion -- our <unk> our <unk> and our <unk>
Have you ever heard another emotion that you show you to look at <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young young <unk> which is going to be <unk> with the idea that his woman <unk>
And Archie says that there was something weird in that man, which is not <unk> in what he did in the wife.
Because she was <unk> everybody knew.
The poor creature was under any cause.
But he was looking for things that made his wife, without giving it, behaviors <unk>
<unk> <unk> or a <unk> <unk>
Freud says that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> describe very well how the <unk> are going to look at the intensity but no precision.
In fact, how much <unk> <unk> we are, we are more going to become <unk>
And for this reason, I think, the <unk> take us to do a <unk> or <unk>
The <unk> makes us very much <unk>
Now I'm thinking about the age eight years, and I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
One woman of <unk> of 52 years of age was written by having created a <unk> <unk> in Facebook from which he would send <unk> messages to themselves, for a year.
For a year. All a year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his <unk> <unk> I have to remind you that when or this, I would play with <unk>
Because we're going on.
How big though we do -- creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
As a novel of <unk> <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorite projects.
She's a very strange character in the American literature,
It's the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to think about our minds and once we are in the sphere in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk>
Let's take her <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> is about <unk> or want you to take it out of your will be and <unk> of what you've ever done, and it's under the floor. It brings your <unk> <unk> your <unk>
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the <unk>
I can't give you to <unk> all the world, both as sometimes I wanted to.
It's a ridiculous because we live in a time of <unk>
We live in times.
I mean, we're very good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show the <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not secure, when they are in a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> <unk> Street and <unk> by <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that genetic agenda.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the boss face of <unk> <unk> that needs to <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> <unk> but it does.
Oh, I sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but the <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in the each of them.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you get <unk> <unk> to all with his solution, <unk> it gets <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says that there is no person in <unk> <unk> that I wouldn't want to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the days that we see <unk> <unk> in history. It looks very simple, that scene is also <unk> right?
It looks like to treat the <unk> like a <unk> problem.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute are the same side.
Suddenly <unk> it allows you that idea of being <unk>
It could still be so easy.
What happens if the <unk> are actually a subject of geometry -- just a matter where we allow us to be in relation to each other.
Well, maybe we don't have to be <unk> of the benefit of the other.
We can <unk> with it.
But I like to <unk>
So while we hope that happens, we remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Just the fiction <unk> <unk>
The fiction used the <unk> she invites the table.
And look at what the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in a great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On the top of July of July of the Universal Declaration of Lake 1997, <unk> jumped out of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>
Armstrong and Mahmoud were alone, but his presence in the gray gray surface was <unk>
The <unk> program was the greatest <unk> in the American history.
To get to the Moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or the four of the federal communities.
Mr. <unk> work to a couple of people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and local organisms.
<unk> including <unk>
But before the <unk> program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> <unk> on his surface, which we lived after death death last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you start?
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the <unk> of our ordinary home.
Why did the answer is that they were because the president Kennedy wanted to show the <unk> that this nation had better <unk>
But the own words of Kennedy at the University of University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> some ask, why does the <unk>
Why do it make it in our <unk>
And they could also ask, why is the more <unk>
It makes 35 years ago, why will you fly on the <unk>
Why do you play <unk> against <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We decided to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult to be difficult.
Jason <unk> the <unk> was not just a victory of the West on the West in the Cold War.
In the time, the most strong emotion was <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>
They were because it was great to do it.
The United States in the moon happened in a context of a long list of <unk>
The first half of the 20th century, produced the line of <unk> and the airplane, the <unk> and the vaccine for sharks.
In half of the century, the <unk> and the <unk>
Technology seemed to have a lot of the thing that you had <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For the most of the history of humankind, we could not go faster than a horse or a ship and a ship and a ship on the <unk> 10 miles to 40,000 miles /
Since 1970, no human being has become the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the age of <unk> 10, and the <unk> optimism on the power of technology has been able to see that problems that we imagine that we imagine the technology would be going to be able to go to Mars, creating the cancer, or feed the population population seem to be <unk>
I remember looking at the <unk>
I had five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't have <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk>
I knew that this would be the last mission <unk> but it was completely sure I would see the colonies in Mars.
So that's what it happened to our capacity to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard of the two days here, at TED.
It looks like that if the technologists would have been together, and they were able to be able to be able to be <unk> and they had <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that are going to be <unk>
There's nothing bad in most of these things.
They have <unk> and we build our lives.
But not <unk> the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There are a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less high companies than <unk> of the years in which it was <unk> providing Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are <unk> in particular, the incentives that the risk of risk provide the <unk>
Silicon Valley says that the investment investment that are <unk> the creation of ideas <unk> by the funding of <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the risk of risk were in its higher point without the risk of risk to risk -- to be a little bit about the risk that could be out in 10 years.
The <unk> have always had problems to invest with benefit in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is long-term long-term to solve big problems because they don't have a wrong <unk>
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and deep things.
Sometimes we choose to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if you do it.
NASA even has designed a plan.
But to go to Mars would take a political decision, and that would never happen.
We're not going to Mars because everybody thinks there's more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global consumption of energy sources of energy sources like solar solar and the <unk> of two percent, and the reason is completely economic development.
The coal and natural gas are higher than solar power, and the oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of dark energy that can compete on the price.
Now, technologists, and economists are supposed to agree about what policies and international treated the development of a <unk> <unk> a significant increase in research and development and energy, and some kind of control of the price of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate economic policy that we will see an energy policy of America or international treated that code <unk>
And sometimes the big problems that seemed -- and they looked at it, they have to be.
We know from time time that the systems are result of the failure in the food business.
But 30 years of research has taught us that the systems are economic economic crisis that affects <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like spiders or systems for the environment, and the food systems -- but there will be ubiquitous while there's bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president was declared the war to cancer in culture, but we soon discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some <unk> <unk> to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and leg.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can have and we know, but these four elements have to be <unk> the political leaders, and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions have to support the <unk> must be really <unk>
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve big problems, which is <unk> with those things.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition as in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> how hard and the dangerous, and there's not a popular mythology of science.
We actually go to the moon turned to the moon turned to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I didn't even have a problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions to the future will be more difficult to find.
God knows that we are not going to get the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> the ideas <unk> that you have about trust.
They're so common that have become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first is a <unk> there has been a great decline of trust, it's a very high belief in the <unk>
The second is a <unk> we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> the goal, and the task has <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal, and a job, which I think it gives a more clear idea about it.
First of the <unk> why people think trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
And it comes to me to think that it can be driven in some activities or institutions and that could have increased in others.
I don't have a clear.
But I can turn to the study of view, and the surveys of opinion are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has gone down.
When you look at the surveys of opinion over time, there's no lot of evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, we're constantly journalists and politics, remain <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very <unk> 20 years ago, they remain pretty much <unk>
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half to half of it.
But this is this evidence for it?
What we have to see are, of course, <unk>
What else can you have <unk>
What you look at is the attitudes <unk> that people have been done when you make certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if you ask you to ask you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
So probably <unk> for ask, "What do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> answer.
And you could say, when you say your question, "Well, I trust a few -- but in other <unk>
What is very extraordinary.
In the end of the real life, we tend to measure the confidence in a <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain type of <unk> or the kind of person -- it's going to be uniform in all the cases.
I could, for instance, to say that I trust a certain degree of the history that I know to give the class, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
It could trust my <unk> friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
One:
And if we have those evidence in our traditional lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we left out of all that knowledge when we think about confidence in form more <unk>
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real confidence because they are trying to get the good <unk> to the fact of trust something or in anybody.
Second, what happens with <unk>
The goal is to have more trust.
<unk> I think it's a <unk>
It's not that the goal that I would have <unk>
I would be able to have more confidence in which it is <unk> but not what it is.
In order I am <unk> I don't trust what's not <unk>
And I think those people who are <unk> with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, and I think -- yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal, in this life.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
One time you say, you know, do it mean that what matters itself is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is this is to do a <unk> about how they do are people in certain ways.
And I think to be able to do a experiments, we're forced to focus on three things:
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be <unk>
But if, for the contrary, they're not <unk> we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things -- but I see that <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If you know, I haven't got to me.
But that's what we're going to do is what we're going to be <unk>
The confidence is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to eat.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we have tried to build <unk> systems for all kinds of institutions, industrial institutions, and so that we made it easier to the task to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you know, the problem is that it takes more time to do the <unk> <unk> that I will go to <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the operating system, which is supposed to ensure and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What do you do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard jobs like <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know a similar examples.
<unk> all that, by the goal.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you were going to be worthy of confidence and <unk> to the people who are <unk> and if you want to figure out whether other people, officials are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the <unk> the simple actions -- the <unk> which is not going to happen as well.
Second, the task.
<unk> to the task to reconstruct trust, put things to the same way.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, in the end is terrible, because we give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give you the <unk> enough to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because of course, is why you can't do it for all people, all the time.
But you also have to use <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
This is a lot of a lot of parts, they do the ordinary people, the <unk> the institutions, the institutions,
I'll give you a simple example.
The store where I buy my <unk> says that I can <unk>
I carry them and give me the money, or the change of the color I want.
That's a good thing to be in them because they are going to be vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of confidence and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So at the end, I think we're going to be this is not very difficult to <unk>
In what people trust is in the relationships, and in that session, you can determine when and how the other person is <unk>
Thank you.
Since the early early computers have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone up and more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one <unk> the glass of a <unk> screen, and the power of computer has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask me, and if I had no <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
First of the first created this tool that goes up in the digital space, so when the <unk> strong against the screen screen, their body <unk>
The designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D and surgeons can practice with virtual organs below the screen.
So, with this tool you break the <unk>
But the two hands are still on the screen.
How do we get inside and interact with digital information using all the <unk>
In the division of Sciences <unk> of Microsoft, along with my <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and it turned a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
<unk> a <unk> <unk> cameras to detect the toes and the face, now you can raise the hands of the keyboard, and we put up on the hands of the 3D space, and finally, <unk> directly with the hands.
As the windows and the files have a location in the real space, it's so easy as a <unk> <unk>
You can go through the book and <unk> lines or words with the virtual motor sensor that there are down from every floating screen.
The architects can come up or rotate their models directly with the hands.
In these examples, we get <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we ask the digital information to us?
<unk> many of us are going to be bought and <unk> things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> for the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understand the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea over this idea, I thought, instead of just seeing <unk> in the space, how we can do it be physicists so we can <unk> and <unk>
How would it be a <unk>
In the Media Lab of MIT with my <unk> <unk> <unk> and my <unk> <unk> <unk> we created this only physical <unk>
This magnet <unk> <unk> as a machine in 3D in space, which means that so much the computer as the users can move the object to any place within this tiny three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and controlling the movement through a combination of red, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And when we test the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space and space, which means that the humans can be <unk> and go back to <unk> and they have to be in the physical world.
You can teach <unk> and the distance and the famous takes from Michael boss, you can play it as a physical reality, sometimes sometimes you want.
The students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of the planets, physics, and unlike the <unk> or the books of design, this is a real experience, and so you can play it and <unk> It's very powerful.
But what is more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical relationships.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show you something that would begin to be directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without that we have to go from our world.
So we started talking about a barrier, but if you go back that barrier, the only limit that is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for <unk> with all the <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted to become engineering, like them.
After traveling the Industrial Revolution <unk> they believed that there was just a <unk> path to the <unk> a safe work and <unk>
No matter if I work or not.
But my dream was going to be an Chinese <unk>
This was me, in my <unk>
And an opera opera is supposed to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything that I could have to go to <unk>
Up until I wrote to the director of the school and <unk>
But no adult <unk> the idea.
No adult I took it seriously.
Just my friends <unk> but they were children like me.
So it was that at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life is a second thing to be the only thing that I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one to me wanted to <unk> OK.
<unk> books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to America in 1995, and what were the first books that we here?
The ones who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The <unk> <unk> is the Chinese life.
And it's not <unk> <unk>
The Bible, is interesting.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth agreement for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your <unk>
<unk> I said, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> <unk> and to <unk> the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave my habit <unk>
<unk>
For instance, at the beginning of this map I thought was out of place because this is what the students in China are doing.
I would never know that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map means the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the world.
There are to research fields like religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> he offers the gay understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if reading <unk> worked for research, why don't it do it also in <unk> life.
So I started reading books.
You can be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are policies and <unk>
For the <unk> are all <unk> because fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> in <unk> found that you can make a lot of it.
For instance, for the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books gave me a magic door to connect with people in the past and the present.
I know not going to feel used or <unk>
Have a <unk> dream is actually not nothing with what many other have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
The most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, that the dreams, where the passion comes to happiness.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it is because of the books, which I'm here -- happy, living again with purpose and <unk> most of the time.
So the books are always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a <unk> student.
She was a <unk> woman called <unk>
Alex went to the first session using pants and a <unk> <unk> was jumped on the sofa, of my office took the shoes and said I wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My girl had a <unk> like first <unk>
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I believed that I could do it.
But I didn't do it.
With the stories of <unk> that Alex brought to the <unk> was really easy to move your head while you get to the solution.
"The <unk> are the new <unk> he said, "What? And so I looked at it, she was right.
You start to work after, the house later, it has kids later, until the death goes later.
So for <unk> as Alex and I had time of <unk>
But just after my <unk> I asked me to press Alex to talk about their life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "I'm going to go out with the guys under their <unk> <unk> with a <unk> head -- but it's not like if it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "It's not, but maybe it was <unk>
Also, the best time to work in marriage marriage is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not new <unk>
Yeah, people feel head after you get <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex were a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem, and I had real consequences not only to Alex and their life, families and the future future and the future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 80 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think nobody comes to the age of <unk>
Hands up if they're in their <unk>
I want to see the <unk> of here.
Oh, Yes! They're incredible.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take the dream of a <unk> I want to look at a <unk> I want to look at it -- it's fine.
This is not just my minds. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will move to the 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments and moments that give his life has been in for when they have 30 and <unk>
People from <unk> not <unk>
This public is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have a exponential impact on the amount of money that we have <unk>
We know that over half of the Americans are <unk> they live or they're coming out with his future <unk> for 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up his second and last stage stage in their <unk> and <unk> for the <unk> which means if there is something that wants to change themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> which in any other moment of life, and we know that the female grows comes to the <unk> and things become complicated to the <unk>
The <unk> are the time for <unk> on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are fundamental for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment where their daily life, and common has a <unk> impact on the person who are <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in human development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of the <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk>
The journalists <unk> <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that drives the <unk>
<unk> <unk> said to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
It's not about anything.
And he sent that person to the sense of tone and their ambition and it doesn't happen to all.
And then all of the days -- very interesting smart, interesting as you or their kids and children go to my office and they say something like this: "I know my <unk> is not good for me, but this relationship is not good for me, but this relationship is not to kill them.
Or they say, "Let's say that while I start a career before the 30, all being right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
He had better <unk> the day I graduated from the <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes for the <unk> were like the game.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some time about 30, the music and they all began to sit up.
I didn't want to be the only thing that you were going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have my husband because he was the closest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, it sounds a little bit better, but you don't have the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure to the two and so many of them to start a career, to choose a town, and they choose a couple or to have two or three children in a period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that you start to show you, which is a lot harder to do, and we want to do everything about once the <unk>
The research crisis is not about buying cars.
It's about realize that you can't have the career to do now.
<unk> realize you can't have the son that you want now, or you can't give you a brother, your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
So here's a story of how it could be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At the '80s, she came to my office because he was, in their own words, having a research crisis.
He said, I would like to work in art or in the column, but they could not be able to say that I spent the last years working as <unk>
As it was more cheap, I was living with a <unk> which showed more <unk> that you are.
And despite living a very hard <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then the same time, she would say, "You don't understand his family, but it can choose their friends."
Well, one day forth, came his head on his legs and I witnessed it for almost a whole hour.
I had just to buy a new <unk> for <unk> and there was all the morning <unk> with their many advice, but then he was looking at the vacuum space that follows after the words in case -- please <unk>
I was at the point of <unk> when he saw it and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I was <unk>
At that moment, I had a lot of work job, and I don't say, <unk>
What forth, needed was not a <unk> which is really <unk>
I needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot of that I worked with Alex as to just sit as a decade -- while the decade <unk> it came down.
So for the next weeks and months and months, I told you, three things that all <unk> man or woman deserves to know.
First of all, I said when she was <unk> from that economic crisis and <unk> capital capital.
By capital capital -- I mean to do something that <unk> value to their person.
What is a investment that you want to be later.
I didn't know the future of the <unk> career and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: capital capital created capital capital.
So now it's the time for that work from the country of the country, of that company that you want to be able to be.
I'm not <unk> the exploration of <unk> I'm <unk> the exploration that I should not say that, by the way, it's not <unk>
It's <unk>
I said when I was working on work and that I would do a <unk>
Second, I said when ordinary tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take to you at the airport, but the <unk> that they put with friends with minds like you know what you know what you know, how do you think about how to think about how to think about how to think about how to think about how to think about how to think about how to think about how to think about how to
That new piece of our distribution -- that new person who came out of it almost always comes from outside of his nearest circle of his <unk>
The new things come out of what you call <unk> <unk> friends of their friends.
Yeah, half of the <unk> have a bad work or no work.
But the other half no, and the ties is the form of <unk> to this group.
Half of the jobs created never <unk> then, to meet the boss of your neighbor is the way to get a work to work.
It's not doing? It's the science of how information is happening.
For the last thing, but not less importantly, when I believed that you don't understand their family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as <unk> it would soon <unk> his family when I have a couple of a couple of a couple of your own family.
I said when the time to choose their family had come.
Maybe they think about the 30 is better age to come up and even 25 or even 25 and even 25 and even 25 with you.
But choose the person who you live now or <unk> now when all of you start to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means to be so <unk> in love as you're in the work.
<unk> your family has to be a conscious choice of who and what you want to place instead of just doing it to work or kill time with who the <unk>
So, what happened with <unk>
Well, you know, that <unk> and she found a quarter of a cousin of a cousin that I worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak weak helped get a work there.
That supply supply gave him a reason to leave the <unk> with the ones that alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I send me a letter that would say, "Now the spaces of audiences of students are not <unk>
The story of Emma can sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
The <unk> are like airplanes that come from the city of Los Angeles, who come into some place in the West.
Right before the <unk> a slight <unk> in his trajectory makes the difference between land or <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or at 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good TED TED TED TED can have huge effects in the years, or even in traditional generations or even in the early generations of the leaders.
Here this is my idea <unk> to spread all the way you heard about.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege to tell the <unk> as forth, all of the intellect, the <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> will use their relationships -- you choose your family.
Don't let it define why they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> work in <unk> so for a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I was going to teach them to <unk> mathematics in New York.
And like any professor, I set up and remind them and tests.
I was able to stop it.
When the work was, <unk> <unk>
What I called the attention was that it wasn't the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones who had a better care of <unk> <unk>
One of my most smart children were not going to do so well.
And that was going to think.
The kind of things that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and it was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you have success in school, and in life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn in a quick way and Rob
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all kinds of scenarios -- and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the Academy <unk> West <unk>
We try to predict what <unk> <unk> in American training.
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what kids are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be possible in the competition.
We studied teachers <unk> working in neighborhoods really difficult, <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of the last year and <unk> who will be the more effective to improve the results of their <unk>
We partnered with a different companies, asking what of these <unk> they are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all of those very different contexts it came up a feature as a major <unk> of success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't the good <unk> physical health and it wasn't <unk>
It was the <unk>
The determination is passion and <unk> for a long term.
The determination is to have a <unk>
The determination is to embrace his future, day after day, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to do that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high students who did my <unk> <unk> and then I waited around over a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out the kids with more determination -- they had more more likely to <unk> even when the <unk> in every feature that I could recreate things like the family income, the results of the evidence -- even the security thing that felt kids when they were in school.
So it's not just in West -- or in the National <unk> of <unk> where the <unk> is also in school, especially for the children of <unk>
For me, the most amazing thing about determination is just what we know about the science about their development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How development makes the determination in kids?
What do I have to do to teach kids a secret ethic of work?
How do I keep keeping it for the long <unk>
The more honest response is, I don't know.  I know this is that the talent didn't give them to it.
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of individuals who are simply not still running with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination is often not related or it is even related to the long-term health?
Up far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination is something called <unk>
This is an idea developed at the University of Stanford for Carol <unk> and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not <unk> that can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and the way it changes and grows in response to the challenge, are much more likely to <unk> when you think that <unk> is a permanent condition.
So the amount of growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because there is where we are.
That's the work that we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas -- our stronger things, and we need <unk>
We need to measure if you've been successful and we have to be willing to <unk> to start to start all of new with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain to do that our kids are more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in <unk> like the daughter of a <unk> one of my more <unk> one of my mother <unk> the beauty, the way and the figure of the Chinese music.
From that moment, I would give me for this incredible language.
But for a profession, it looks like to be as <unk> as the Great <unk> China.
In the last years, I've been wondering if I can carry this <unk> so that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new way and quickly to learn Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years ago, I started to learn how to draw each of the <unk> of every character in the right test.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes -- it's better than we do it in a way and very simple and simple.
A Chinese <unk> 20 thousand characters.
You just need a thousand to understand the basic training.
The first 200 people will allow us to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, so enough to read signs of <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of the pages or Antarctica.
We start with eight to show you how the method.
They're ready?
We open their mouth as much as it could be possible until it is possible.
Take a mouth.
This is a person who is going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the way of fire is a person with arms in both sides as if they were <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the way of <unk> but I like to believe that it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors.
I call this eight characters.
They're building building so many more characters.
One person.
If you walk back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are <unk> three are <unk>
If a person makes his arms, this person is saying <unk>
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
One tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Take a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
They put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, you know, a <unk> tree, is quite <unk>
Do you remember the <unk>
Two together, it becomes very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of <unk>
<unk> fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Take the sun and the moon of the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after a day and a night.
The sun comes on the horizon.
One door. You put a board inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
I'll put a mouth inside the door to do questions.
<unk> Jesus has someone in your house?
This person is coming out of a <unk> <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, have care is <unk>
So we've already been at almost 30 characters.
As we use this method -- the first eight radical would allow them to be able to be able to be able to build us.
The next group of eight characters to build other drugs.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of <unk> which is the same thing that you learn a Chinese for eight years.
So after I meet the <unk> we started creating credit.
For instance, the mountain and fire together, we have a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun put up with the <unk> because Japan is the east of China.
So a sun along the <unk> we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do you have?
A Japanese person.
The character to the left are two mountains in the other one.
In the old China, that meant in <unk> because the Chinese <unk> to their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the <unk> has become <unk>
A mouth that tells you where you go out of the way.
This is a slide to remind you that I have to leave and go back from the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the films that I have to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years ago, we saw the magician <unk> together.
The movie <unk> their imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and to take a little <unk>
But at seeing that movie so many times, you have to understand that it's extraordinary.
Now we live and bringing our children in a kind of industrial <unk> <unk> <unk>
However, the magician of Oz was a event in itself.
It didn't started that project?
The trend really took to rise up to 40 years old, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> <unk> kid and a kid <unk> <unk> to a girl in the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There are a huge difference between these two movies, there are a couple of big differences between the magician and all the films that we see today.
One is that there are very high violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive as the <unk>
But I think that if the magician magician would do today, the magician would say, <unk> is the <unk> of Oz like the barrier to <unk>
<unk> shoes in order to meet the brand, they created by the computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
And another thing of the magician <unk> is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started seeing this when I did see <unk> <unk> my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I also had a son of it.
Just three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of <unk> had <unk>  So it was <unk> in the room and it was impressed as an mom on the room and he was impressed to her <unk> and I don't think he was going to understand what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> themes and <unk>
I would have the feeling that Luke is a <unk> for <unk>
<unk> this with the magician of <unk>
How do you make to remind your movie?
They were good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow <unk> OK?
Why do we have so much force capital and force in movies for our children, and so little <unk>
There are a lot of literature about the impact of the films of violence in the girls, and they should <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this time?
I know by experience that <unk> <unk> doesn't give me the appropriate framework that would have been done to navigate the world of the adults who is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first <unk> I really expected to look at because it's the end of the film, right?
My search has done, I have <unk>
Why do you follow it there?
I don't know what I have to do.
The films are focused on the <unk> and get their <unk> and not leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like to be a child, you have to be a brilliant animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are many exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to kids, even though them, they are not really his goal.
They make a <unk> work to teach girls to defend the <unk> but not necessarily show kids how to defend from the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have a few big women who write new stories for our children, so real and <unk> and <unk> but they don't leave to be <unk>
Of course, the most successful issue in all of the time continues to happen, in color after the adventure of a kid or a man, or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or his son, or his son, or his son, or his son, or his son, or his son, or his son, or his son, or his son, or his son,
Up until many of you are thinking, this year, eventually came to <unk>
I encounter all of you. It's available in shops.
Do you remember what the critical when it came out of <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has done a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these films happens about <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It was not not getting roots and already <unk> but maybe we start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and in the age of the years '80s, I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend about the <unk> of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are just three questions that you have <unk> in the film, there are more than a Japanese character that has been asked.
So, there are the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point of the thought.
Their conversations are about something more besides the guy who would both like that.  Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things between yes.
<unk> I think, and yet very rarely I see in the movie that we know and <unk>
In fact, this week I went to see a very good <unk> <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success of <unk> a idea of consensus that is a <unk> movie <unk>
<unk> doesn't happen to <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen, a lot of the movie happens in a city where men and women are hidden during the crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the tools to put a look at the door and say, <unk> to my <unk>
This is Hollywood itself.
So let's go back in the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 favorite films how many people think they have <unk>
<unk> isn't bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women that we have chosen recently in the case -- then it's good.
But there's a larger number that this is going to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times ran a study that the government had done.
This is what he said,
In the United States, one of every five women said that it has been <unk> sexually ever in their life.
I don't think it's the <unk> <unk>
I don't think movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think mathematics videos or malaria are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that <unk> one of the things that I think is a lot of <unk> <unk>
Who are those <unk>
What do you don't get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a Japanese hero is <unk> to the <unk> with violence and then eating the <unk> which is a woman who don't have friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege to raise a daughter like those of you who are doing the same, we find this world and this very odd statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our use, like <unk> <unk> and we hope that that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> yes, at the same time, activated or <unk> we are educating our kids to keep their kids to keep their <unk>
I mean, I think the list of <unk> is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly home.
I think we have to show our kids a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is changing <unk>
You read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite character of <unk> <unk> Do you know what it does.
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common <unk>
Maybe it's not just the <unk>
I think they're <unk>
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than anyone, and I love to share their knowledge with other people for <unk> to get their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories in which I say to my <unk> <unk> and even more stories where I saw that his work is join a team, maybe a team led to women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician of <unk>
Thank you.
And in a little girl, I was living in Hawaii, and one of the things that I liked was to look at the coast of sea in the coast of view, because my parents told me that that would give me so much.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered from sand and it's hard to see this.
However, with the time, I was <unk> to <unk>
I started seeing ways and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion to find things, in a love for the past and the <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I see with my own eyes not enough.
Because suddenly in Egypt, my little beach in general. I had grown up to one of 10 miles on the <unk>
And my <unk> of sea had grown the size of cities.
This is really what led to me to use a <unk>
To try to do a map of the past, I knew I had to see a certain way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a place based on the bars of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, the simple view, it seems to be <unk> but when we use the ideals and we use it using color color -- the place looks like it looks like <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by the materials of building and the activities of the ancient babies.
I want to share with you how we have used the satellite data to find a recent city to find a old city called <unk> <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the old Egypt for more 400 years ago in a period of time called the United States, about 4,000 years.
The place in the <unk> <unk> and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire -- there was this great big <unk> of the ancient art, the architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always heard that <unk> was involved somewhere about the certainty of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is huge about about <unk> for <unk> miles.
Forget the <unk> <unk> right at the side of <unk> and as it changed the time, they moved to this and caught all the city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk>
I try to find the way to look at a needle to look for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes, and using <unk>
So, we use <unk> data from NASA to do a map of place, which is very ambiguous.
We were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly high that looks inside the circle here, we think it could be the location of <unk>
So we're doing with international scientists doing jobs of <unk> you can see it here.
When I say <unk> is like you take it on the ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we're looking for layers of the human community.
Five meters down, below a <unk> <unk> we find a dense layer of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a <unk> layer on the Empire of the Ottoman Empire in the same period that we think is <unk>
We also find <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk>
This might seem to be a lot, but when we think about the most common rocks used in the periphery of the Ottoman Empire -- these are the rocks that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of estimates that comes from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence from a <unk> shop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city in a very important.
We still didn't find <unk> here, but <unk> to place in a close future.
And even more importantly, we have the resources to support young Egyptians in the use of the satellite technology that they can also be able to be able to make big discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire of the Ottoman Empire was probably written in <unk> three years ago.
<unk> knowledge is most of the <unk>
There's nothing like that in the earth.
So according to TED, TED wasn't founded in 1984 <unk> C.
So the ideas actually started in 1984 <unk> <unk> in a city lost not for a lot of time and found from it.
It certainly makes the search of <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to show you to close the eyes.
So imagine a foot outside, in front of the <unk>
I'd like to give you attention to the color of the door, the material that is done.
Now <unk> a group of <unk> <unk>
They are <unk> in a <unk> <unk> and they go into the direction of the <unk>
I need to see this <unk>
They are <unk> <unk> they're <unk> they are <unk>
And they go through the door of his house.
There are <unk> flying around each other, the wheels that goes into his side of the wheels that ended up in places -- <unk> the threshold of the door of the door in the door of the door to the door of the door to the door of the door to the door of the door to the door of the door to the door of the door in the
And so that there is what there is the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light. The light <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>
The <unk> <unk>
From his chair, about a <unk>
It's a horse that's talking about.
You can feel their <unk> blue <unk>
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you spend that it is going to be in your mouth.
<unk> for a side and enter their living room.
Because in the room, and they use their imagination, imagine <unk> <unk>
It's a little bit with a little bit of his <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now let's go back to the kitchen.
The soil has been <unk> with a yellow <unk> path and from the stream, you come to you from <unk> the <unk> and the biography of "The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Okay. Take the eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that has been done in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago like a journalist <unk> I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There was several men and a few ladies and a few different <unk> and different habits <unk>
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers of <unk> <unk>
<unk> the names of tens and tens of strangers.
<unk> poems in only minutes.
<unk> to see who could rely with more fast the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people have to be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and that has one of the best <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realize you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I am not a <unk>
Actually, I have a average memory.
All of those who are involved in this competition say that you have normal memory.
"We have trained we've trained to do these <unk> acts of memory using a few old techniques -- <unk> two years ago in Greece, the same techniques that we used to be <unk> to depend on their gut, and that male <unk> were used to export books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How does I have heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the room in the competition and <unk> who is a wonderful English and brilliant though a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you're a American journalist
You know <unk> <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I would like to teach <unk> <unk> <unk> how <unk> the order in a deck of <unk> in <unk>
That would be able to do the world that anybody can do it.
And I said, "Well, I'm not <unk> <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
You mean, you have to start with something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey.
I ended up the largest part of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it works.
I met a lot of people really really interesting.
This is a man called <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Their memory was so bad that I didn't even know that I had a <unk> problem.
So somebody incredibly <unk> but it was a window that allows you to see until what our memory is what we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> In the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent a evening together in the public library of <unk> Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And when you go back, it was a number of treated on memory today, something more than 2,000 years ago in <unk> in the <unk> and then in the Middle Zealand.
And I learned so many things really interesting.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time that this idea of having memory <unk> <unk> and <unk> was not a thing as rare as you can think about today.
A lot of time, people put in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have done our modern world, but we also have changed.
We have changed <unk> and I would say that we have changed to have changed.
As we have no need to remember, sometimes it seems like we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places in our planet in our planet where they still find people involved for this idea of a <unk> memory memory and <unk> is this competition so <unk>
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk> like this everywhere.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people.
A few years ago, a group of <unk> University of London invited a <unk> group of memory, the lab.
They wanted to know that it has brains in a positive way, or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're more smart than <unk>
They gave them a <unk> battery and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting difference and significant things between the brains of memory and the ones that the <unk>
When they put them into a <unk> <unk> <unk> their brains while we were able to <unk> numbers, faces and <unk> forms of snow. They found that in the <unk> <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
In the effect of <unk> or it seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves space and <unk>
Why? There's something that we can learn about this?
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> is running as a computer race in where every year shows someone with a new way to remember more things, and then the rest of the competitors have to put a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times <unk>
In his desk, in front of it, there are 36 <unk> <unk> which he is going to be about trying to survive, in an hour, using a technique that he invented and he just <unk>
He used a technique like to measure, the precise order of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was in a average hour.
And while there is a huge amount of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all of the techniques used to the end of a concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with an elegant paradox known like the paradox <unk> <unk> says the following: I say two people who remember the same word. I say you know, there's a man called <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then you ask them, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I wonder that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> what <unk>
The person who told him that his name is <unk> is so likely to remind the same word that the person who said that their work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that is extraordinary.
What about here?
Well, the name itself doesn't mean nothing for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
And with all the other memories that dance for their head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk> in your hands.
<unk> well when they get home to work.
Probably a <unk>
And when you put that word for the first time, we started to put <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point later.
One of the most powerful techniques to do this about two years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of the <unk>
The story says like this: There was a poet called <unk> which was a <unk>
He had been labeled as you <unk> because before, if I wanted to give a very good party, they didn't put a <unk> <unk> <unk>
He put out of my <unk> <unk> his poem of memory, and so soon it was, the room of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> everyone.
But not only killed they killed all of them, but it makes the bodies <unk>
No one could say who I was there, no one could remember where they were there.
So they could not be <unk> <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
<unk> was standing out of the only one of the <unk> I closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting on each other.
He took the family of the hands of <unk> where they were their loved loved between it.
And what you do is in that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good to remind or to remember names or <unk> numbers, and the word of our colleagues, we have a word of our colleagues, we have a word of our colleagues, we have a word of our colleagues, we have a word of our
If you ask me to give me the first 10 words of the story that I'm just going to tell you about <unk> is very likely to do it.
But I would try to tell you that if you say who I was sitting on the horse <unk> <unk> in their <unk> would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> of images with things that you want to remember -- the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the image -- to be.
This is a advice that comes from 2,000 years ago to the first treated of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and they want to do it with memory, the same way I would have done -- if they were invited to <unk> a 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is you have in the door of his house.
And to imagine some kind of a absolutely <unk> crazy <unk> and <unk> to help us remember that the first thing you want to mention is that competition <unk>
And then you can imagine entering your home, and you see the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to present to his friend Ed <unk>
And then you would look at <unk> <unk> to remind that anecdote to remind you that anecdote to tell you.
And then they put in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that I would talk to be that strange journey that did for a year and they have some friends to help them remember them.
This is how the speakers -- <unk> <unk> <unk> not word for word, which is going to <unk> but typical for typical one.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in his palace of memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I jumped with that.
I went to some of these <unk> memory and I had the idea of writing something <unk> about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
And seriously, it's like to see a lot of people sitting to you, I mean, that the most exciting thing happens to be when somebody else is going to be <unk>
I am a journalist and I need to write about something.
I know there's incredible things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to get in their place.
So I started going to spend 15 or 20 minutes in the morning before I sit at the New York City -- just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old <unk> school <unk>
And I discovered that this was <unk>
I would never have expected to be <unk>
It was fun, because it was not just about training memory.
What is actually about doing is to improve more and more the ability to create and imagine these images <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I did it pretty much with this.
This is me, using my experimental team for the competition of memory.
It's a couple of <unk> and a few security points, covered with tape leaving two <unk> because the <unk> is the worst enemy of a generation of memory.
I ended up coming back to the same competition that had covered a year before, I had the idea that I could <unk> in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came from control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be <unk> and <unk> and <unk> numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just so <unk> <unk>
Because they're based on very basic principles about how the brain.
And it doesn't need to be able to be able to build <unk> from memory or <unk> <unk> to benefit with a little bit of <unk> about how their mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of a gift -- but it's not the case.
The big memories is <unk>
At the most important level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focused on it to us.
The palace of <unk> these techniques of memory, are just <unk>
In fact, not even <unk>
They work because they do it <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of creative attention that most of us are not <unk> by there.
But the truth is that there's no distance.
That's how things are doing <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave with today, is what you do -- the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence -- in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walk into our hands -- we are going to be so <unk> that we don't even have <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are <unk> skills.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person who remember <unk>
Thank you.
Now I'm going to talk about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so <unk> only a place <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am about <unk> "I was six years old, and I lived there on my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
On the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And, between my bedroom and the bathroom, had a <unk> that was going to be in the living room.
And there are all going to be looking at the date, so every time I was from my room to the bathroom, every time I looked at me, and I came back and I came back and I came back in a guy -- all of me.
And I was like that.
It was not <unk> and I did it.
And so I want to figure out that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
OK.
Those are enjoying those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture. Because architecture is not about mathematics, or <unk> or of those connections that we feel in the places that we feel in the places that we have <unk>
And it's not surprising that we would feel about that way, because according to the <unk> <unk>  Americans spend 90 percent of his time under the roof.
Well, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture is determines in ways that we don't even know it.
That makes us a little <unk> and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would do, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know what you think about a building built two years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that use architects to create a emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we have used this trick for a long long, long time.
We use it 200 years to build <unk>
We use it in the 19th century, to build museums of art.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build home.
You see, these <unk> <unk> in front of the sea, we get away from the elements.
This is very, very useful because we build things is <unk>
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
People who are <unk> and governments are always afraid to innovation and prefer to use ways that you know that they're going to work.
So we found with buildings like this.
It's a beautiful <unk>
This is the <unk> Institute of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown -- and you know, it has a <unk> it has this beautiful thing, Derek, red, red, and they leave the <unk> what you think about to communicate with this <unk> children.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, at the other side of the country, was finished another library, which looks like that.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the town, a place for <unk> reading and share.
So, what is possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both <unk> are so entirely different?
And the answer is that architecture works in the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that constantly improve new technologies -- new solutions for life forms of modern life.
<unk> <unk> and then we get so much of the people.
All of the black, this is <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another choice.
We have to go back to the other side and go back to these symbols <unk>
So we do it, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started to experience from <unk> we ask the one to go forward, and then we have done in the last 300 years, and of course it is in the last 300 years, and of course it is in the last 30 years.
Well, maybe 30 years ago, the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with <unk> <unk>
It has to do with the entertainment.
That can be <unk>
<unk> tiny <unk> <unk>
Something really hard.
So, we get closer to the '80s, and we started bringing these symbols together.
<unk> a new <unk>
We took those ways that we know like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we use a new materials.
I love it.
We don't have <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we put them in <unk> that can be <unk> <unk>
The ways you have <unk> they won in <unk> and <unk>
The <unk> became <unk>
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
Thank you.
But they were the '80s, that was great.
We all spend the time in <unk> centers we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the '50s, we can create our own <unk>
Those devices could be going to be to <unk> to the <unk> or the <unk>
It would be a <unk> <unk>
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the men.
They're easy to be cheap, because instead of creating new neurons, we create memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not <unk>
This is <unk>
The architects are <unk> and we started doing the one of new in the other direction.
In the '60s, and in early early '90s, we started to experience with the call <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> now we have new design techniques and we find it with new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other ways.
This is <unk> and <unk> and it's <unk> You have completely <unk>
Normally <unk> <unk>
But then it happened to something <unk>
In 1997, I took this building.
It's the <unk> <unk> from Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that it was one of those rare moments when it was <unk> and public and public in general, they were entirely about a building.
The New York day, <unk> this building <unk>
<unk> in <unk> increase in a thousand percent when they ended up the building.
So, suddenly all the world wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, New York, 2006.
All the world wanted one, and she was everywhere.
He was our first architect star.
But what is possible to these <unk> and <unk> and <unk> how possible they become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them and quickly we learned that those forms that these culture are going to be.
We've created a emotional reaction with these ways.
The same thing did the world's world's world's world's <unk>
And so they all believed that if they had these ways, they had culture.
This phenomenon of the new <unk> country with other architects star.
And I went to <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new press, actually started to pass with all the architecture. The digital media started to increase the speed of the consumption of information.
Imagine, for example, make architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have walked to the next village to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, a airplane, you can be <unk>
<unk> technology can see in the <unk> and the end of the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building comes beyond their physics.
The architecture is everywhere. It means that the speed of the communication has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving as fast,
It's not going to be a long time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, a architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more than knowing if which I designed two years ago was a success or not.
Because you've never been a good feedback in architecture.
That's how we found with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two years, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to be going to be <unk> because we're in the threshold of the most revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> and the revolution of the media.
My theory is that when it applies to the media media, starts to use increasingly fast, until you get to be in both <unk> and <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you know, the public line.
Now we can do symbols almost <unk> with <unk>
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community.
But it meant that two years before it was going to end the building, it was already part of the community. And as the drawings looked at exactly the product done, there was no example.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to get and do it in social media, the building left out of being just a building, because these are not only images of a building, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that one made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative and that makes it <unk> with memory memory and to carry these <unk> we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet is looking for <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> with examples of innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and you tell you that there is no single response to what it can be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom of <unk>
Everything is different now.
The architects are already not those mysterious creatures that are using words <unk> and drawings and <unk> and you know, it's not a <unk> public <unk>
The architects can listen to you, and you don't leave the architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of a way to another, from a movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems that face society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different to the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the old city of <unk> can be only only and adapted as a modern city.
This means that a <unk> in Brooklyn can be that, a <unk> in Brooklyn, and it doesn't be a bad measure of <unk> <unk> in ideas of what it must be a <unk>
This means that a few robots will be able to build our buildings, because eventually we're ready for the ways that are going to do.
That means that the buildings are <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a number of focused in Miami Beach, Florida, also can serve to make sports or for <unk> or even you can come out there in night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming swimming in the East East in New York, and raise half a million dollars of the community around that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to exist?
Because it doesn't matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we build what it matters is what we have.
The architects already know how to do a more smart buildings and more <unk>
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not in sides of the <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better buildings, to a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings not only think of our society, but it makes it way to the most <unk> spaces -- local libraries households where we are going to our children, and the step of the brakes to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It was just to play a year and then started walk.
And it makes it very great, typical of the children of a year, <unk> like his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is you like to do in the mirror.
She really loves his <unk>
<unk> and <unk> and it gives himself the same <unk> and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Soon all their friends do this and my mom realize that I used to do it, and he did me think, When I had to do this?
How do we suddenly do with our <unk>
Because they didn't like that.
Every month, 10 people looking at this? "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> has 13 years ago and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be <unk> and they live.
It's Sunday for night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little bit better, because, even though his mom tells me all the time that is beautiful, every day in school, someone said to be <unk>
Among what his mom says and what their friends, or my friends, or my friends, you say, you don't know who who would think they think.
So it makes a video of she -- it makes it in YouTube, and asked other to please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has got more than 13 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> which doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a teenager and normal computer, they get these answers to one of the stages of its most vulnerable life to help.
Thousands of people are making videos like this, in their majority girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, the teenagers are almost never alone.
They are under pressure to be online and available all the time, talking about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this is never going to happen.
Never before we have been so rare in a very serious way that <unk> as young children.
As a mother said, "It's like there's a party in his fourth -- all the <unk>
There is just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go out of the hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always <unk> it's <unk> our kids to <unk> based on the number of saying that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There are no division between a line and the real life.
It's really difficult to know the differences between what is real or what it is.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what it is <unk>
What is the most important thing in the life of somebody in front of what is normal in an context.
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> of the news news girls now.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>
The technique of the <unk> is now a assumptions.
And trends <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to do with what the young people are.
But children are not immune to this.
As the <unk> stars and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we really want our kids to grow healthy and they are individuals <unk>
But in a political culture for the image, we are teaching our kids to spend more time and effort to learn their <unk> the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical choices, their studies and other aspects start to be <unk>
six of every 10 girls would prefer not to do something because they think you don't see very good enough.
These are not <unk>
They're fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and as <unk> society and the field of the business development.
31 percent, almost one of each three teenagers are not interested in the <unk> <unk> to participate in the arguments of classroom because they don't want to call the attention for their physical ways.
One of each five are not going to participate in all of the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the <unk> <unk> if you don't think you see it enough right, specifically if you don't think you're <unk> enough to the average of your colleagues who don't care about that in the way.
And this phenomenon has spread in the United States and China, and China,
And it gives you how they actually put these young children.
So to be good of course, we are talking about how you can see what you're really true.
The low performance on their body is <unk> the <unk>
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with time <unk> are less <unk> they eat less fruits and evil, are involved in more income, not healthy that can take you into a food <unk>
They have low self-worth.
They're more easily <unk> for the people who are around and they are in higher risk of depression.
And we think it is all of this why they make decisions more <unk> as the consumption of alcohol and the consumption of alcohol and drugs, informal sex relationships and without protection and damage to <unk>
The search of the perfect body is to put into the health health health health and our government cost billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who think they have <unk> again, if you have or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
The 17 percent of women are not present to a job interview in one day where they don't feel safe with the way you see it.
Think about a moment where this is doing our economy.
If we could get to overcome this, what would it be like that.
<unk> this potential is for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking for themselves, you don't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things -- you have to do something.
And we have learned that there are three key ways that we have to trust their own bodies.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to get the pressure of the perfect images and building their self-worth.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned a lot of <unk> programs -- without giving it, <unk> the situation.
So we have to make sure that the program that follow our children are not just going to have a positive impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six areas -- the first is the influence of the family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are <unk> points for any willing to provide a education in the body building that will work.
One education is fundamental -- but to deal with this problem requires a one of us that we take <unk> in the issue and we are a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
It makes the current status status of how women are <unk> and I hate in our circles.
It's not good good to tell the <unk> of our political <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of the <unk> or the success of a nonprofit athlete depends on the fact that it's not a huge beauty.
We need to start to judge the people why they are, not like you are.
All of us can begin to be doing to make responsibility for the kind of images and behavior that we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> the people based on their effort and their actions and not in their own.
And let me ask yourself, When was the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities like governments and like companies, to change our culture, so our kids would grow the whole person in the leaders, and the <unk> <unk>
We have to put people who are really making a difference in a <unk>
So to make a difference in the real world, let's make them that they go on the big screen because we just will be able to take a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of them, where the way they think that you see that you see that you can have the <unk> of being who are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what it can mean for somebody in their lives.
Who are in mind?
The <unk>
The <unk>
The <unk>
The <unk> <unk>
It could be just the woman who is going to two seats from a distance. What would it mean for her, if it was liberated from that <unk> voice, which was <unk> for not having long legs -- a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So what would it mean for her, if we do it and would say that it is <unk> to the potential of that way?
Right now, the dreams of our culture with the images are going to be <unk>
But <unk> our kids the truth.
<unk> that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love for those who are and so they do it, and by how they do it <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's do each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so the little <unk> of a year of a year of today, they will become sure of the same morning.
Let's do it.
The five <unk> of 1990, a gentleman called <unk> <unk> I went to a hotel in Manhattan and <unk> the <unk> leader <unk>
The <unk> was forced to be <unk> but they are going to be <unk> by other operating charges in the company of each other, they started planning attacks to a few <unk> New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations <unk>
For luck those plans are <unk> by a <unk>
This is the bomb pump in the World Trade Trade was not being able to be.
Later, <unk> would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my dad.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer engineer with a <unk> stem mother <unk> <unk> the two did all the possible for giving me a happy.
Only when I was seven years ago, our family started to change.
My dad taught me a way of Islam, that very difficult, even most of the Muslims are going to know about.
By experience I saw that when people take time for it, it doesn't require a lot to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion in all of the human group, there are always a tiny fraction of people who are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to use their <unk> who think there is to use all the media that we all lived like them.
A few months before the arrest and he sat up with me and explained that in the last weekends, he and some friends, he had been doing to training training.
He told me that I would go with him at the day.
It comes to the <unk> <unk> <unk> that we didn't know our group, I was <unk> by the FBI.
When I had <unk> my dad helped me hold the <unk> in the shoulder, and he explained to me how to point to the goal of 30 feet.
And that day, with the last bullet that he took to the little orange light on the goal, and to surprise all of all, all of me, all the goal of the goal of <unk>
My uncle became the other and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
So for a father, a son.
And all of all, the comment was produced a lot of it, but just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
You see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be <unk> by putting a <unk> with 700 pounds of <unk> in the entire area of the north Trade Trade Trade Trade -- causing a explosion that killed six people and spread to other <unk>
I joined those men.
The called called "The <unk> which means schizophrenia.
When I was born, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood childhood didn't get me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about somebody was already able to climb and get to another city.
As I always was a new face of the class, often was <unk>
<unk> my identity, my identity to avoid being the white class, but to be the new <unk> and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent in home, reading TV or playing games.
For these reasons, I didn't have social skills to say to say <unk> and it was <unk> it was not prepared for the real world.
And I was able to be able to judge people, with <unk> <unk> like your race or their religion.
So, how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put my way to test my way to think, was during the elections of 2000.
In a <unk> program where I was born in the National <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of <unk> violence like I had been a <unk> <unk> almost my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, to the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who had done was a single day.
I took a few days to go to light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two of them.
I had never had a single friend and frankly I felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all the life had been done to believe that it was <unk>
Another critical moment came when I got a job of summer in Bush <unk> a <unk>
I found me with people all kinds of beliefs and cultures that experience fundamental in the development of my character.
All the life was taught to me that the <unk> was a sin and by 2004, all the gay were bad <unk>
So I did had the chance to work with gay actors, there in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most happy and less implications that had seen in life.
I had a <unk> of a child, I developed a sense of empathy to suffering from others. But it was not easy for me to try to translate the way that I would have to be <unk>
So for that feeling I could put the stereotypes that had taught me with the experience of the interaction in real life.
I don't know how to be <unk> but I know what is going to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then he came out the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart was doing to be <unk> honest to my <unk> and I helped to see that the race of people, religion or sexual empathy, have nothing to do with the character.
In a lot of ways he became my figure on a moment that I was desperately <unk>
In occasions, the inspiration can come out of the unexpected. And that a teenager had had a better influence in my life that my own father, <unk> was not in all.
One day, I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that I would save my heart for always, while it's alive.
And she looked at me with my eyes tired of somebody who has been <unk> enough with <unk> <unk> and he said, "I'm <unk>
At that moment I realized how much dark energy is required to keep all that hate in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So, why did I decided to go and put in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done that because I hope to someone, some day, who was going to give me for violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way to tell me that even though I would give me to this great way, and <unk> I didn't have to get <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against <unk>
I do what I do for the victims of terrorism and by their loved pain and the losses that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
By the victims of the terrorism talking against those acts like rejection to the actions of my dad.
With this <unk> I put up here as a proof that violence is not inherent to no religion or enough that kids don't have to keep the pathways of their parents.
I am not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you everyone.  Thank you very much.
At this moment there is a film that was done in their minds.
It's a <unk> <unk>
It's in 3D and has sound <unk> of what you hear and you see right now, but that's just the beginning.
You have a movie and you can't know and texture.
They feel your body, your pain, your <unk>
It has to emotions, anger and happiness.
It has <unk> as a little moments of your childhood coming back to your eyes.
And it has constantly constantly <unk> in your form of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience all in it.
This movie is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of existence of the existence of the human being.
Every single one of us is conscious one.
We all have a <unk> <unk> you, and you.
There is nothing that <unk> more directly.
At least, I know I have an consciousness.
I don't have certainty of you to be aware of you.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of us, nothing in our lives would have sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we have to be able to produce results without experience the movie <unk>
At this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I need to integrate awareness to science, they need some radical ideas.
Some people say that is impossible for consciousness.
The science, by nature, it is hard.
<unk> by nature, it's <unk>
So you could never exist a science of consciousness.
Because during almost all the 20th century, the vision.
The psychology was studying behavior <unk> neuroscience studying the brain <unk> but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, was very few people in consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, it all started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> they said, <unk> is the time for science <unk>
And since then, there was a real <unk> a <unk> work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental constraints to the moment.
The center of the future of consciousness in the recent years, was the search of <unk> they are among some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this kind of fantastic work that introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
Now we understand a lot of better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or to be happy.
But this is still a <unk> science.
It's not a <unk> science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of experiences.
I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what you make certain areas of the brain and with what is <unk>
But in a sense, those are the <unk>
No <unk> <unk>
Actually, there's no simple problems with consciousness.
Well, you don't go to the real central mystery of this <unk> why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by the <unk>
Why is a <unk> <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's give you a few years to the <unk>
It's going to convert in another emerging phenomenon like the <unk> like the <unk> like life, and we're going to find an explanation to it.
The <unk> <unk> are all cases of behavior -- how do you use the <unk> how do you work <unk> and <unk> the living organisms are all questions about the other goal.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon -- how do we talk about how we're trying to play <unk> all are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between the simple problems.
But the complicated problem is the question why all behavior is accompanied with a <unk> experience.
And here is the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I am a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that will become a long time, I was able to play your head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in terms of physical terms.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk>
I think we're going to be <unk> at this point.
We have a <unk> chain chain -- it would be used to this, the physics explains our chemistry, the chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this <unk>
On one hand, is a fact that we are important.
For another, we don't know how to put that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't know how.
And with a <unk> like this, you can have a radical ideas, I think we need ideas that the early <unk> would be able to deal with the consciousness of a scientific business.
There are some possibilities for those <unk>
My friend Dan <unk> is here today, it has one.
Their crazy idea is that there is not such a hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the traditional movie process includes a kind of illusion or <unk>
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the functions to the behavior of the brain, and that is studies all that you need to success.
Well, more power for it.
That is the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of political consciousness <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time, for a lot of each other, that vision is pretty close to the way that the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time that I <unk> I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe like <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> laws that <unk> as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and properties are not explaining in terms of more basic <unk>
The contrary, you think that we think that the world.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental thing is <unk>
In the 19th century 19th century, he discovered that you can't explain the microbial phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- so long, the laws of <unk> and so <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electrical laws like a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we found with consciousness.
If you can't explain the consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space -- time, so long as a matter of logic, there are the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as something fundamental a fundamental country of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not a object.
But it opens up the way for <unk>
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect the awareness with other concepts -- space, the time, the <unk> the physical processes.
Cities sometimes say that we want laws as simple that we can do in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like that.
We want to find fundamental laws as simple that we can do it in a <unk>
We don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> all of all, every system is conscious -- not only human beings, the mice, the mice, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that fishermen are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with that when I think I'm always traveling to the speed of light.
I can never slow and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe the fishermen can have some of a sense of a sense of a sense of a sense of a sense of a sense of <unk> <unk> some adventure of consciousness.
This can sound <unk> for you.
How would someone think something as <unk>
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental as the space, time and the mass, is natural that it can also be free, like the others.
It's also worth to notice that though the idea seems to us -- is a lot less for the people in different cultures where human mind seems more a continuous with nature.
One deeper reason comes from the idea of the idea that maybe the most simple form and powerful laws that we think about the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Because there's information processing information, there's consciousness.
<unk> of <unk> complex as in a human <unk> consciousness in a human consciousness.
<unk> of design, simple consciousness.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and the developed <unk>
It has a mathematical mathematical measure of the information, which is called <unk> which is the degree of information about a system.
And I'm supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there is an incredible degree from information, a degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
And in a mouse there is a degree of information, just pretty much unlike consciousness.
But when it comes to the <unk> microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is <unk> but it's not zero either.
In the theory of <unk> there are still a different level of zero.
It was actually telling a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of <unk> high than consciousness.
Also, another reason is that the <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
The physicists and philosophers have often have seen, that the physics is <unk>
It describes the structure of the reality using a lot of pain, but we don't talk about the reality that <unk>
As it explains Stephen <unk> "Where is the fire of the <unk>
From the view, the equations of the physics can leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, -- consciousness is the one that makes it fire in <unk>
In that vision, -- consciousness is not in the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's there in the center.
This vision, I think, the <unk> vision has the potential to do our relationship with nature, and it can have social consequences and ethical and pretty serious things.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that there was nothing that I had to eat consciousness, then I should be <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you get that vision, you have a lot of consciousness.
I think think about this, this tends to transform your <unk> while it matters in terms of <unk> and <unk> <unk> not both the fact of consciousness, but their importance and their complexity.
It's also natural to ask by consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system, in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the view of the information information -- she has an complicated information processing processing -- so the answer is yes, if it's conscious one.
If this is right, you think of <unk> problems on the modern ethic of the developing health systems and the ethic of <unk>
Finally, you can ask by the consciousness of <unk> the planet.
Canada has their own <unk>
Or to a more local level, a group of <unk> like the audience in a TED talk -- this moment we have an collective collective consciousness for this early group of the TED group of each of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question that you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's right.
Actually, I'm actually more sure of the first exciting idea that consciousness is something fundamental than the second thing that is universal <unk>
The view of a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those pieces of thinking to be a kind of complex consciousness that we know and I love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going to be on the right way to a theory of visual consciousness.
If not, well, probably this is the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait at the night to the morning.
But I think eventually we will go to <unk>
<unk> consciousness is the real key I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small village, rural <unk>
He had a very normal profile one under education.
I went to school, I was going to tell me with my friends, my friends, my friends, <unk>
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years ago, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for an community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very beautiful but there's a problem.
She doesn't actually have a <unk>  and they had right.
I went to school, I was good for the school, I had a good girl in the school, I had a little profile in the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, what happened?
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
None of you can be considered to be used if we take the disability outside the equation.
(Audience: later, I was in the second part of the teaching in a high school school, in a high school school, as only after about 20 minutes in the class, 11 studies -- a guy got his hand and said, "Hey, when when you get your <unk>
And I said, "What is <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a few minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When the people in plastic chairs are talking about <unk>
All of the general in the room.
And it was then when I gave me this: This kid had had to work with people with disability as objects of inspiration.
And we don't are. And it's not <unk> of the <unk> I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, the people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not no real people in there for us.
And, in fact, I am in this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair and you probably have you to have a <unk> Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we have to have a relationship to our disability.
Yeah, they have sold the lie that disability is something <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a bad thing to live with a disability makes it extraordinary.
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make a bad <unk>
And in the last years, we've been able to increase even more this neighbors through social communication.
It's possible to have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> is <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a huge amount of them.
It can be that you've seen one of the girl with a <unk> playing with a pencil <unk>
It may have seen a kid who runs with <unk> legs of carbon.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the term <unk> <unk> because it <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> to the <unk> of the people in the benefit of the people in all.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and say, "Well, for pretty bad that my life, could be worse.
I could be that <unk>
But and if you're that <unk>
I've lost the number of the number of times that have been strangers to work, to express that I think I am <unk> or a source of inspiration, and this would happen before my work had a public question.
It was like if I was <unk> by the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are <unk> to the people with disability in benefit in the benefit of the people in all.
They're there for you to look at and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a <unk> person is actually something difficult.
<unk> some things.
But the things we need is not the things that you can think.
They're not <unk> things in our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> <unk> because I was <unk> to the so-called social model of the <unk> which tells us that we are more active because of the society where we live in our bodies or <unk>
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with it.
It makes things that I need to do, and I've learned to take the best of your capacity and so like you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures too.
They're not doing anything outside of the common.
They're simply using their bodies getting the best of their ability.
So, it's really just just <unk> in the way we do, to share those <unk>
When people say, "You are a source of <unk> it says like a bird.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the <unk> because they have sold this lie that disability makes us a real thing.
And I can cut it out.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> <unk> and you think -- oh God, you're not sometimes inspired by something.
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability in all time.
However, not <unk> I am more lucky than them.
<unk> which is about a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to collect things that you get to me --  <unk> the nice trick of how to put the telephone battery in the battery in the chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of the others, not our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really think that the lie that have been sold about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us very hard.
And that's <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's <unk> is because the social model of 2006.
A lot of <unk> to a <unk> <unk> has not done to be a <unk>
Never.   <unk> to a television television is not going to be <unk> for the <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a village and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to live in a world where disability is not <unk> but the norm.
I want to live where a little girl at 15 years, sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> not <unk> not <unk>
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people with disability that we are <unk> to get from the bed and remember our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the expectation of the people with <unk> and I want to live in a world where a kid from 11 degree in a high school school, is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> machine.
Poetry doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think about what you think about it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the reality reality, and the <unk> of the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk>
Unfortunately, we're just going to answer one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think that you actually think about <unk> <unk> and in Tom <unk> the hands in the air, but the reality reality is not science fiction.
The reality reality is something that happens in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to figure out because the Internet reality is so much like the Internet and mobile phone.
So how do we get to the reality.
The first step, is what I wear <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm sure many are familiar with them.
What maybe you don't know is that the Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
I'll experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would do with their imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, under a helmet and knowing what it is to run by the field of play to 160 <unk> the blood <unk>
So we can know that a <unk> man, we get <unk> trying to <unk> with all their being.
I've been there and I assure you it's not a nice thing.
<unk> some videos to show what is to use Google <unk> under the '50s, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the practices of the <unk> because the idea of the <unk> of modern technology is a underwater going to the surface -- but we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment. <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is going to be <unk> in the field of <unk> from the perspective of <unk>
You have given people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> of the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> eight, <unk> <unk>
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the feeling -- but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, to be their favorite players and have asked me in YouTube and in <unk> "You can see from the angle of a <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that.
Once we have this experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which you probably know that.
The <unk> <unk> has been described as the modern virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual virtual reality.
And I'm going to show you why we're doing this video with this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, <unk> I don't want to keep <unk>
Oh, my God.
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a <unk> <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you put a video of <unk> <unk> crossing the line, <unk> of a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> What's the experience of a <unk>
When I could be <unk> running by the <unk> to the bottom of the controls, or <unk> doing a <unk> in <unk>
What will be his experience when it comes from a mountain over 100 miles as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it was <unk> with <unk>
But this is not actually <unk>
It's just the real reality of <unk>
How do we get <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality, when the <unk> <unk> and they had to see the information about what people want to see and say, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to make <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
I like to win. They give you money.
So here's a brief goal, about technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> <unk> would put a <unk> to his <unk> <unk> so I would play more fast.
They won the Super 2000, that year.
Others decided to <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put <unk> in the <unk> of the field and after the <unk>
They were more <unk> because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that you are a player going back to his group and you see his next time you see in front of you, in a plastic <unk> that are getting together, you don't have to worry about a <unk>
Or by terms of the strategy.
You just go to the field and <unk>
And the <unk> they want to think because if you don't follow their <unk> they lose and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose <unk> <unk>
And they don't want that.
But reality, it's not just a <unk> <unk>
The reality reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How do you do?
Well, a very simple choice would be to have a camera in every corner of the lake having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You can also get information from the sensors of <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all of that information is your <unk>
The good teams will be <unk>
The bad people are going from information.
This is <unk> to the good teams of the things.
So, your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis to be just just for all.
It will be also <unk> who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that they're the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> to a open receiver of a sudden, a <unk> in the bottom left of your <unk> <unk> <unk> that a defense behind you <unk> <unk> not <unk> but the <unk> system.
<unk> the area of protection.
Another <unk> you know, there's a open coffee.
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And he loses the trajectory.
You don't know where the receptor looks like in his <unk> a area of grass that goes and can modify the career.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The public public and <unk> have been following the way from every angle.
This is something that creating a mass emotion in the game.
I'm going to have lots of people you see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field,
They want to be his favorite player.
The reality. will be part of the sports because it's too far to be.
But what I ask you is: we want this is the only use of the reality.
We're going to use as bread and <unk> as our entertainment entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use the reality that we can use the empathy between human beings, to show somebody how it is, literally, to be in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It was billions of income per year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how a <unk> is their actions from the <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they live <unk>
How much is a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of notes <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the reality reality.
The questions that we do -- the decisions we take and the challenges that we face <unk> as always, of us.
Thank you.
I was born, after 23 years in the <unk> <unk> from California.
Most of those 23 years ago, I spent the end of the end of the south county from <unk> which includes the bridge <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure that is known by their beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for the France, being one of the most used places in the world.
The bridge <unk> <unk> was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer would have to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is practically to test <unk>
<unk> for the bridge is not <unk>
But from their openness, more of 1,000 people have killed their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that to travel between the two towers will carry up to another <unk> this bridge has been <unk> as a <unk> such that each of the concerns and pain.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to be able to make <unk>
After a free four to five seconds -- the body against the water about 120 miles per hour.
The impact is <unk> a few of those who are <unk> a few of those who are <unk>
Most die in the impact.
The ones that no, they're usually <unk> in the water <unk> and then you get <unk>
I don't think that I would put this <unk> method to realize the <unk> <unk>
This is the <unk>
Except, around the two situations, there's 32 inches of steel from the bridge.
Here is where most people were in order to have to have a living.
I can tell you by experience that once the person is in that edge, and in its more dark, it is very difficult to bring it back.
He took this photo last year while this young man was talking to a officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with glad that we had success that day to bring back on the <unk>
When I started to work on the bridge, we didn't have no science training.
<unk> to implement the way through these <unk>
This was not just a bad service to those who are <unk> but the officers as well.
We've got a long way since then.
Today, Muslim officials and psychologists trained the new American things.
This is Jason <unk>
I met the 22 <unk> last year to get a call of a possible subject -- I was sitting in the garden near the center.
<unk> and when I died, he looked at Jason talking with a official officer.
Jason had only 32 years old, and she had <unk> until here from New Jersey.
In fact, there was <unk> until this two times before in New Jersey to try to kill him from this bridge.
After about a hour talking to <unk> I asked us if we knew the story of the box.
<unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent the Earth to the Earth with a box, and he said, "You never hear that <unk>
Well, a day, curiosity was more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And of she came up <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked them, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> he woke up to the right, and it was gone.
This little kid and smart <unk> in New Jersey had had had to have a life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, I didn't seem to be very well, because the next day, the concerns of the family called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had been asked of it.
<unk> <unk> <unk> to a lot of people.
I put them these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved was <unk>
What do you start?
What does that?
In my experience is not just to talk to you, but you have to hear.
Listening to understand.
Not <unk> <unk> or tell the person that you know how to feel, because you probably don't know it.
You just go there, you can be the point of <unk> that you need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you don't have afraid of <unk> and make the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about the end of his life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> to the person of front can save life and being the point of <unk> for them.
Other signs of <unk> let's believe that things are terrible and they're never going to <unk> <unk> to believe that there is nothing that you can do with <unk> social isolation and a number of interest in life.
And I came up with this talk about a couple of days -- and I got a email email and I would like to read your letter.
She lost his son at the age of January, this year, and he wrote this email a couple of days -- and it's with her permission and wanted to be the end.
<unk> <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience.
I'm thinking, I'm going to go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to give you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home, talking to their friends who tell your friends, so on.
I'm still quite <unk> but you know, more moments of realize that Mike won't go back home.
Mike was driving <unk> to San Francisco, to see the <unk> <unk> with his father <unk>
I never came there.
I called the police police and <unk> and <unk> as a night.
The next morning two officers came to my house and told me that the <unk> <unk> was down in the bridge.
He had seen it from the bridge to the <unk> of the evening of the evening of the day before.
Thank you very much to fight those who can be <unk> too close to fight themselves.
Who has not been done to be wrong with a real disease.
It wouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My <unk> are with your struggle.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful arms, not a <unk>
Good luck this week <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and left the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
The 11 of March of 2005, I was meeting a radio call for a possible subject for a possible subject in the bottom of the bridge near the tower around the north tower around the north tower around the north tower around the north tower near the north tower near the north tower near the north tower near the north tower near the north tower near the north tower around
<unk> my <unk> and I looked at this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When he looked at me and he looked at the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the <unk>
For the hour and half the next time, I heard like Kevin spoke about their depression and <unk>
Kevin decided to realize that day to go on that <unk> and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin <unk> <unk>
"This is a new life.
But I asked him, "What was what he did is what he did -- and they gave life to hope and life.
And you know what he told me.
He said, "I <unk>
I had to talk and just <unk>
Soon after that incident, I got a letter of the mother of engineering, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing to erase the events of <unk> and you're one of the reasons why Kevin keeps us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> by help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental disease for which it has been <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I only had six months of all those traits <unk> but thank God, we know.
Kevin is in order, as the <unk>
So we give God for you.
I'm born with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she wrote, <unk> When I visited the General General of San Francisco, that night, you have <unk> as the patient.
<unk> I did have to do it.
Today, Kevin is a <unk> <unk> and a active member of society.
It talks openly about the events of that day and from their depression with the hope that their story to inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I found in work.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> <unk>
And so you know, sometimes to end their own pain, I give me the chance of <unk>
This is what he does.
For most of the people <unk> or those who think of it, they don't think about <unk>
They just want their own <unk>
By general, this is just about three things: except drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've been able to say and I've been involved in hundreds of mental diseases and calls around the bridge.
And of those incidents that I've been directly involved today, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other was a man who was talking about a hour.
For that time, I was going to get up in three times.
On the end, and he looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely terrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we came to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
In addition to those few who have killed from the bridge and lived and they can talk about it, that one one, or percent, most of those people have said that the second ones that you stop on the second that they were done and wanted to live.
I say people, the bridge is not just connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that all and each of us have to be used to do.
<unk> can disappear.
You have help. There are hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't do, but in your interior you know what you do, and a question -- how do you ask you in that?
I have to be a single thing in that sense, but I'm not just a single way of any way I'm alone.
When I became a model, I felt that I finally had the dream that I had had had for a girl.
My outside finally <unk> with my real truth with my me.
So for complicated reasons, which I'm going to go later later, when I look at this picture, I'm thinking, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that <unk> I'm going to be.
We all gave us our families, our men, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the color of the skin, or by the beliefs of those who are all around us.
They are people who are always saving the <unk> <unk> which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years ago, a lot of my friends, a lot of my friends, my brother, even my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I had a <unk> like <unk> because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in my home, I always had to put this <unk> in the head.
And my mom asked me, "Why don't you hear that <unk> in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, is my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender has always considered a <unk> but now we know that, actually, is more complex and <unk>
Because my success, I would never tell me to share my story, not because I think to be what I'm wrong is bad, but why the world is about those of us who want to be <unk>
All the days I appreciate to be woman.
I have my dad and a family who are telling me as I am.
Many are not so proud.
There's a long tradition in the culture of the culture of gender.
There's a <unk> of compassion.
There's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight years ago, I was in a party in the United States, that I witnessed these branches.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something was <unk> This is the kind of woman that I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years ago, when I was still a man -- I met this woman called <unk>
It's the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why don't you've done in the <unk>
He said to me that if you <unk> she was <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> and that night, I won in <unk> <unk> and he was third <unk> between 40 <unk>
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly I was inside the world of the <unk>
Not a lot of people can say that his first work was from <unk> <unk> but I know that.
I also met the <unk> of the <unk> above all when it was going to go back to the remote provinces
But most importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In the 2001 my mom. I had moved to San Francisco, I called me and told me that she came back to the green card that I could go to live to the United States.
I was <unk>
I said to my mother, no, I am <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called it and said, "You know that if you go back to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all that I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me that I would put two <unk> to my name.
She also came to me when I was <unk> at the age of 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most cities of the cities are going to do the more sophisticated surgeries and they could.
In that time in the United States, it was necessary to do the surgery before the name and gender.
So, in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the license license with the name <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
It was a great.
For some people, their computer document means to drive or able to get a <unk> but for me was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could recognize my dream and move to New York, and to be model.
Many are not so proud.
I think about this <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman of New York who was <unk> in the truth, but that <unk> took his life.
For many of my community, that is the reality that they live.
Our drug rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20 of the 20 of the 20 of the 20 of the 20 of the <unk>
I'm in this stage thanks to a long story of people who are <unk> and he put up to the North age.
These are Vila <unk> <unk> and Sylvia <unk>
Today, at this same moment, I'm going to go from the <unk>
I can't keep living on my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help the other to live their truth without <unk>
I'm here -- <unk> so that you have no more <unk> of 20 <unk>
My biggest truth took me to accept what I am.
Do you do that?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you,  <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> first, thank all my <unk>
And to my network of support, my parents inspired to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young young women who have <unk> and sometimes when I was called and sometimes when her parents were not able to embrace it, and I took my mom and said, "Look, can you call this <unk>
Some times worked other no. It's just identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all met a gender to birth, and what I'm trying to do is to put on the table -- the subject that some times that task is not difficult, and that should have a space that would allow people to do, and this is a conversation that we should have to be <unk>
The <unk> movement, is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There are still a lot of work to do.
Should I have understanding.
I should have space for curiosity and to do questions, and I hope all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> societies and <unk> the parents usually you know for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who is known for his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education to learn their rights in 2007. And when you get their efforts in 2011, the National Geographic <unk> of peace was made very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, was my daughter, but now I'm his dad.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you get a look at the history of humankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of violence and politics.
You see, in societies <unk> right from the beginning, when when I was born a girl, his birth is not <unk>
It's not <unk> not for his father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood goes back, day their <unk> to mother and nobody <unk>
And a mother <unk> a lot for a girl.
When it gives light to the first girl, the first daughter, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When it gives light to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when I was <unk> his third daughter, it feels guilty like an affordable.
Not only the heart mother, but my daughter <unk> <unk> when it comes up as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you have to go home and the dance to their <unk>
Up until the age of 12 years, somehow it has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with their friends in the street, and it can move through the streets as a profit.
But when it comes in the income, when you spend 13 years ago, it was <unk> to come from his house without a <unk>
It's <unk> at four walls in their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes called the call to honor his father and their brothers and their family, and if you <unk> the code of that course -- I would even kill you.
And it's interesting that this obviously code is not just affecting life of a <unk> it also affects the life of American members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and happiness of their sisters in behalf of the stories.
And there are a more <unk> societies that is called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl must be very <unk> and very <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
They are supposed to be <unk> and he enhances the decisions of his father and their mother and the decisions even if they don't want.
If the <unk> with a man who don't like or if the <unk> with an old man has to be <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If the very young <unk> has to do it.
Instead, the <unk> <unk>
And what does it happen?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation, is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson to <unk> their daughter and the same lesson to honor their children.
And this vicious circle continues and it's going on.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when she was born <unk> and for the first time, believe that I don't like <unk> to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe that I felt <unk>
And so much before I was <unk> I thought in his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter so for it.
But when I <unk> all were men, and I took my pen, and I took my pen, and <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she came on, when she was four years old, and a half years ago, the <unk> in my school.
You know, why do I have to mention a <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I have <unk>
You can take it for sitting in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in European societies, is a great event for the life of a girl.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of their identity and his name.
A <unk> to school means that it has done in the world of the dreams and the values where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to the school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when I had <unk> the form of <unk> and I was in the relative part of my family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any microscope.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father was not able to give my sisters and I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The <unk> to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to <unk> in their personality.
And this wasn't just for it, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and kids for the same.
It used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson to forget the lesson of the call <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we find it with a new place.
It was <unk> for human rights, and in particular, for the rights of women.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete <unk> of the participation of women in all social political activities, economic activities, and social activities, and social policy.
Hundreds of schools were sick.
And the girls were going to get to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> girls and the singers who are <unk>
<unk> million, but a few <unk> and it was <unk> to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights rights.
It's really important.
At the 10 years, <unk> and he got out of the right to education.
He wrote a day for the blog of the character, he was offered his same for the New York City in the New York Times, and I spoke in every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It's <unk> as a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not be able to tolerate his campaign and the nine October of the 2012, he was left to <unk> in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and for me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I was <unk> to hear my wife <unk> <unk> so I went to my daughter, to your <unk>
And <unk> he said, "Please don't get <unk>
<unk> the cause.
<unk> your life in play for the cause of the truth, because of peace and for the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and get <unk>
They were both in the right path, and God <unk>
These few words -- so much for me, and I didn't start to ask again.
When I <unk> was in the hospital and he had <unk> and strong headaches of head because their facial nerve was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that would be <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used <unk> "I'm good with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to do me, please, not <unk>
It was a difference for us, and we <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we have learned of her moments more difficult, and I'm pleased to share with you who despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like any girl in 16 years.
<unk> when you don't have his task.
They fight their siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special in my <unk> which has done as <unk> to <unk> so impossible and <unk>
I say, "I don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
I didn't cut their wings and that's everything.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion of a personal <unk>
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently recently joined the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> but all the work that I talk about today about the science of the brain, and I did it before I put Google or outside of my work there.
When I said this, there is a stigma when you give you to a operation of the brain.
They're going to be smart or not?
It won't be like this, you could be <unk>
After the <unk> I had a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the dark matter, but it was the part of the <unk> of the center that creates hormones and <unk>
And then I knew, after the operation, I had to decide what we kind of <unk> from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, they would be in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about <unk> and <unk> and try to <unk> to keep with life.
More than once I've been saved to me.
But luckily, I have no soul of <unk> so I decided to be <unk> to try to get the doses of <unk> which really doesn't have a clear map that would say in <unk>
I started to test with each other, and I was surprised to see how little changes in the seventh doses -- my sense of who was me, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months ago, I had a <unk> and chemical chemicals for a man and I was surprised to see how to get my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I believed that it was the most smart person from all the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've been known in the past I've been known in the past -- or maybe some versions of <unk>
It turned up as a end.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> fixing a problem that had the front, and it was just not going to happen like that.
So, I couldn't do it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience I gave me a new way about men and about what they have to do, since then I carry it better with men.
What I was going to be able to be able to do with those hormones and molecules, and so on, it was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thought of ideas.
<unk> thinking almost in images, and that became my point of reference to <unk> how to do those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you get <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> look at things like similar things.
They thought images and ideas and ideas were the same thing.
Now today, there are those who you know, this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind. For the most of us, the mental imagery are fundamental for the thought of <unk> and <unk>
So after several years, I can find the point right and I have a lot of great <unk> <unk> <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working in how to take these very quickly these simple images of my mind to the screen screen on the screen floor.
You imagine what would happen if a movie of movie was able to use their imagination just to run the world that has to be.
Or if a kid could extract the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way people people can have to share the speed of light.
And the truth is that, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply increase the resolution of our brain systems.
Let me show you why I think we are pretty close to this with two recent experiments, that we have been done by two recent experiments in all of the <unk>
They both used technology -- <unk> image to represent the brain here to represent the brain here -- and you can see the species of Harvard.
The column of the left shows the <unk> of a person who looks like a image.
And the column of the middle shows the <unk> of the brain of the brain of that same individual -- while you see that same image.
The column of the right was created <unk> the content of the central column of the left -- you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with a lot of different images with a similar result.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagine seeing that same image is almost different.
Now, let me show you another experiment. This is the <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves.
Let's go from this way.
In this experiment, he showed the people hundreds of video video of YouTube in YouTube while they put their brains to create a huge <unk> of the brain of the brain to the sequences of video.
Then, I showed you a movie with a new, new people new animals, and while so much <unk> a new <unk>
The computer, using the brain information -- the <unk> to show what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and to the left, the video I showed you.
This brings us <unk>
We're good about doing this.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember that when you see a picture and when you imagine that same image, it creates in the brain the same <unk>
This has been done with <unk> systems of more resolution available today, and their resolution is running as a thousand times in the last years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we do it.
There are many techniques to do it.
One is to open the skull and to go to be <unk>
I didn't give me for that.
Many are proposing new techniques of projection by images, even me. <unk> with the recent result of the <unk> first we have to ask the next next thing to be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get more resolution is with the largest magnets -- but at this point, magnets <unk> only provide little improvements in the contrary, it's not <unk> for thousands of how we need.
I met this idea: instead of <unk> <unk> let's make better things.
We can create structures -- much more complex and slightly different -- like doing a <unk>
And why do it happen?
In the last years, a huge amount of effort in the debt were to make magnets really large, right?
However, most of the recent advances in the <unk> of <unk> and bright in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> in <unk> systems.
At the time, instead of a magnetic magnetic field -- <unk> mechanical patterns.
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the silk processing processing <unk> we can increase the information that you can extract in a <unk>
Also, we can divide in layers of our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
When we use the <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the motor hormones and <unk> that I've mentioned and maybe even the neural activity is sleep.
We could be able to put our ideas in form to digital media.
You can imagine if we could spend above the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how to learn to deal with the truths of human thought without <unk>
You think the Internet is something big.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> as a tool to build our health skills and communication.
They were not the same tool could take the cure of Alzheimer's and disease disease.
We have a few options more to open this door.
And anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that to take a lot more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I want to talk about this night, and not in a traditional sense, not just the <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
It's going to be to tell some person for the first time that loves love or tell somebody who is married or tell somebody that you have cancer, or any other conversation that you have done in life.
All of it is a difficult conversation, and even though our themes can vary <unk> the experience of being lived and have been from that <unk>
Da fear, and we don't like it and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the South <unk> <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the town, and there was there, I had to go through a lot of <unk> from the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it will be <unk> that for the <unk> of my short <unk> and so I had <unk> the head made -- I would ask me a kid -- "Hey, say, you're a kid or <unk>
And then it would be a silence for the table.
<unk> my jaw a bit more, I would take me my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and my mother had a cold look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and <unk> on it.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to place where there was a kid between three and 10 years ago, I was ready to go to <unk>
And that's a terrible.
So I promised me that next time I would say something.
I would have that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks ago it happened again.
They're a kid or a <unk>
A family silence but this time was prepared and she was prepared to go back in the issues in the table.  I had the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a degree of the organizers of the <unk> that <unk>
So I took up and I went up and I came up and my hands and my <unk> a <unk> girl with a dress of four years ago with a <unk> I look at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: Are or <unk>
And so I took it down and again, I put back to me, and I said, "Hey, I know this is a <unk>
I have the short hair like a boy, and you see <unk> <unk> but I am a girl, and you know, like you like to use a dress <unk> and sometimes you like to use a <unk>
Because I'm more the kind of girl from a <unk> <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> and said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and it has a fish.
I can give you a <unk> for <unk>
And that was everything. It's just a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the hardest conversation of all that I've ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, so many we were <unk> the one with the other one.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the darkness, you can't know what color color is the walls.
You just know how one feels like a <unk>
This is how my thinking is not different to you or you know, or for you.
<unk> will give you 100 reasons why to come out of me was more difficult to go out of it, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The difficult thing is hard.
Who can tell me that you explain to someone who have declared <unk> is more difficult to say that it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I story is more difficult to say to your <unk> <unk>
There is no more difficult, it's just the hard.
We have to stop <unk> which is hard to do with what hard for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy, because we all live very difficult.
In some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make you feel security, or at least security than offers the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what they're done in their walls, a <unk> is not a place to live.
Thank you.  So imagine the same 20 years ago.
I, I had a <unk> tail and <unk>
It wasn't the <unk> <unk> prepared to fight any <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark <unk> my <unk> <unk> and the <unk> only a muscle is the hardest thing ever ever done.
My family, my professional friends, strangers who I've spent my entire life that I've spent my entire life, trying to not <unk> and now the world went back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we have all been following for so long, but if you don't hear that <unk> I'll kill you.
One of my <unk> <unk> <unk> was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of the invited they knew that I was gay, and to do my <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the rock, and eventually I came back to one where the friends of my parents and eventually came to one where the friends of my parents were people who knew to me.
And after I talk about a moment, one of the women <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had <unk>
<unk> ever had in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is, we have friends in St. <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard it is <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your <unk> program.
Our <unk> program and <unk>
And you know who we have <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but I'm waiting to show your support, to get to me know that I was in my side, finally said <unk> "Well, sometimes my husband uses <unk> <unk>
And I had a chance at that moment, like you have all the <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find and realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask to someone, but <unk>
If you are going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you are.
It's like that the hard conversations remain without being my strong.
Ask any of the ones that I had <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call three early principles of the <unk>
Now, please see this through the perspective of the perspective, but you understand that what it means to be out of the thing is essentially the same thing.
Number one: <unk>
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for the stream.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the other people have to know that we also have to be.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> their <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If you say their parents that maybe could be gay, they will keep hope that that could change.
Don't give you a sense of <unk> hope.
And number three, and more important --  thank the complex things.
You communicate their truth.
They would never get to be <unk>
And some of you can go out of a safe <unk> <unk> so they have done, but they never say by what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are all the expectations of them about what you are, but you don't see it.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So next time you find in a dark <unk> <unk> a <unk> to know that we've all been there before.
And it can be very alone, but they don't are.
Thank you, <unk> <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has seen the intelligence -- a productive example of <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is so interesting as the question of whether an actor.
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical to the <unk> of the computer like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, we put a program to try to understand the physical physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's go back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you are a <unk> race that you don't know about biology of biology in Earth and no intelligence of the Earth of the Earth -- but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth for millions, and they can see the Earth for millions, even billions years.
And you see a very strange.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid a impact.
But if you are a modern race that doesn't know about this, which doesn't have any concept about intelligence on the Earth, you would see forced to develop a physical theory that will explain how, until some time in time, the asteroids -- the surface of a planet.
And so why I think this is the same question that we understand human nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to place several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues across science, through several ways, that <unk> I think, to a single mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for instance, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems like to be appropriate to development of intelligence development, and in particular, for the developing states that are <unk> the diversity of possible experience.
Finally, in the <unk> movement, there has been a recent techniques that have tried to take the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action with the end of doing complex ways.
And so, taking all these different themes and <unk> together, I asked them for several years ago, there was a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's just a equation for the <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the more close to a <unk> and it was <unk> for the intelligence that I've seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a force force, which acts with the end of maximize the future freedom of action.
It tends to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the options open with a wrong force, with the diversity of possible future, Yeah, until a <unk> time <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and to keep the biological options.
And so having to realize this equation, it's natural <unk> What can you do with this?
How does it happen?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you a video that I think, to show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in prescriptions have suggested that the universes that produce <unk> or <unk> during their life, they should have trend more sensitive to the existence of smart beings like us.
But what happens if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence <unk> a more <unk>
What happens if the smart behavior is not just connected to the production of entropy throughout the long run, but actually comes directly to it?
So for that, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy throughout any system where you find inside it.
<unk> <unk> was able to spend multiple evidence of human intelligence playing games and even earn money -- and we want everything to be able to do that.
Here are some of the <unk> examples of action.
As a video of a foot without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically take a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided to find the <unk>
This ability to balance is will have applications for robotics robotics and technologies of human technology.
This ability to use tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, as some other animals can cooperate drop from <unk> <unk> at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can make a version of the model of that task.
This ability to cooperation has interesting implications for economic development and in a variety of other places.
<unk> is widely pillars to a variety of <unk>
For instance, here we see that we see playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> <unk> new connections in a social network where my friends are constantly connected and keeps success with the <unk>
This same capacity of <unk> of network also has applications in health care and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> to organize the routes of a fleet of <unk> discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to extend the global level from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely pillars to problems in defense and transportation.
Finally, here we look at <unk> they find and run a <unk> strategy in a series of <unk> <unk> to increase assets under their exponentially.
This ability to management of risk is going to be <unk> applications in <unk>
Alex <unk> what you've seen is that a variety of <unk> of natural behaviors -- such as the use of tools use the use of tools -- walk and social, all of a single equation, that leads to an equation, to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term of the term <unk> the work <unk> there was always the concept that if you were <unk> machines would have a <unk> <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we have had all the concept of <unk> <unk>
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and they try to figure out the world.
It's all the other contrary, you can take the control of all the future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence that intelligence can actually be done directly from taking the control, instead of being the other way.
Another important consequence is the search of the goal.
I often ask me, how do you look for goals -- this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants to help us build <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence -- is the following: intelligence has to be seen as a physical process and avoid the constraints of action and avoid the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're in a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of the stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
In the last years, we have a lot of our knowledge knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The AIDS mission of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets that orbit around other stars, which shows that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
East is a space telescope, which is the intensity of the <unk> <unk> of the stars when the planets go through in front of them, and to make a little bit of that light that will come to us.
The data, the data was born by Chinese, show the production of the planets in the distance that there's between them and their mother.
We put it helps us to understand whether these planets are little and <unk> like the edge of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get out of their <unk>
At his time, this was clues about if these planets that we find are <unk> or not.
Unfortunately, while we are finding this <unk> <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
Last year, it was the <unk>
<unk> and ice ice who have been with us for us now in the course of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused to global scale, have been quickly quickly our ability to alter their course.
But I am not a scientific scientist, no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by stars, with hope to find places in the universe where we find lives beyond our planet.
You could say that I'm looking for <unk> opportunities in the sector.
Now, like somebody very interested in the search for life in the universe can tell you that the most finding planets like the Earth -- more than our own planet.
Every single one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the planet and all discovered and the planets that we know <unk> our solar system.
Let's take our move.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit more far from the Sun, it can be considered a <unk> world.
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past and in part, is why we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> extract their surface in search of clues about the origins of life and as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> as the <unk> mission take samples of the atmosphere and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies can now provide not only short space space space -- but also the possibility of living in Mars.
But despite all of these images <unk> we remember the realm of our planet, places that are related to our imagination with ideas -- and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still going to be <unk> places in comparison with Mars.
Even in the most effective places and more on the Earth is cool and full oxygen and full oxygen for our forests to thousands of miles away.
I care that this excitement for the <unk> of Mars and other planets will give you a big and sad <unk> and the belief and the belief and the belief of some of the planet we know that is actually the Earth.
So for a lot to like the exploration of <unk> I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons, to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is like to imagine that the captain of the ground, we will tell us that the party actually will have place later in the <unk>
But the goals for economic exploration and the <unk> <unk> not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and improve life in the future.
The advanced environments in our world looks like <unk>
It's only closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces in the hostile areas of the ground, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and to go beyond that.
I'll leave you with a <unk> experiment.
A lot of years ago, the physical bandwidth -- I asked them to realize that our universe has been done for a long time, and we hope that there are many planets in this universe, we should have found the evidence of the existence of life to right now.
Well, where do you are.
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of fact, is that when the civilizations will become advanced enough enough to consider living between stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the origin of the planets that we use this development.
It's <unk> think that only the <unk> <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the <unk> <unk> can work together.
So if we really believe in our ability to put to the hostile environments of Mars for human presence -- then we should be able to overcome the task even more easy to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I got my own home.
And while I was in the front of the front of my friends, I realized that I didn't have the end.
In fact, I could see the window that they were in the table of the ceremony where there was <unk>
So fast I tried to open all the other doors and windows and all of them were pretty well.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my mobile phone, but at the midnight, a <unk> could take a lot of time in there, and it made cold.
I couldn't go back to my friend of Jeff to spend night, because I had a early flight to Europe to the next morning and my <unk> and my <unk>
<unk> expensive, but sure that no more expensive than a <unk> for half night, so I thought, but despite the circumstances in the right room.
I am <unk> <unk> and I know a little bit about how the brain works.
<unk> <unk> that increases the heart rate, <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And when I was going to <unk> <unk> in the airport, I realized that I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to wonder, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in their place, which would happen to be bad things.
Or at least, if you look at bad things -- which is the probability that it is a <unk>
So I had to think about that, but to a month after my thoughts don't <unk>
I was <unk> with my colleague Danny <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and a little bit, he spoke to the window, and that I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Dr. <unk> who had written from this a few years before, known as the <unk>
They all know what the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what it came wrong, right?
In the <unk> like it says, <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that could go wrong, and then try to figure out what can do to avoid the things that are going to be able to help the damage.
So what I want to talk to you with you is a few things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> other are not so comfortable.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the home, <unk> a place for things that you lose easily.
This sounds of common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that comes to this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There are a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved throughout thousands of years, to make a transmission of the location of the important things where the fish, which are the fish, where the fish trees and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that is <unk> in the <unk>
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find their <unk>
And if you ask whether somebody actually did the experiment, <unk> the sense of <unk> and yet they could find their <unk>
They didn't use the fish, but the hippocampus, that mechanism really evolved in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that are not going to move a lot, not so good for things that are going to get a lot.
This is the reason to lose <unk> <unk> and <unk>
So in home <unk> a place for the Los Angeles to the door, maybe a <unk>
So for his <unk> a particular feeling.
And for their <unk> <unk> a particular <unk>
If you get a place and they're <unk> with that their things always will be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take up with the mobile cards a picture of his credit cards from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If these things are lose or <unk> this can be <unk>
These are some of the more obvious.
Remember, when it's under stress, the brain builds up.
The <unk> is <unk> and <unk>
So part of the practice <unk> is to recognize that under the best time, and you have to put the systems in their site.
And there are perhaps not more excited that when you face to a doctor.
And at some point, we all will be in that situation, that we have to take a very important decision about the future of our medical attention or the one of a matter to help us with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of the social decisions and in fact for the rise of financial decisions.
So let's assume you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've received the result of the lab and the <unk> is a little <unk>
They all know that the high <unk> is associated with a higher risk of infectious disease attack the heart, <unk>
So you're thinking that having the high <unk> is not the better, then the doctor says, "I would like to give you a drug that will help rise the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and he knows that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even probably you know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic which is supposed to ask that most doctors don't want to talk about and global companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or <unk> to a surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And it must think what kind of statistic <unk> is <unk>
The number should be one.
My doctor didn't be <unk> something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, the medical practice doesn't work.
And it's not <unk> of the doctor, and if it's <unk> is the scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the <unk>
But the estimates of <unk> than 90 percent of the drugs works only about 30 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> what you think about it?
How many people have to take it before you help a person who will help you.
I guess.
This is according to research research -- <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take drug for a year before to avoid a year to avoid a single heart attack, a brain <unk> or another event <unk>
Now maybe say, "Well, one probability in 300 of my <unk>
Why did it not, <unk> the recipe of all <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more, and it is, <unk> of the effects.
For this drug in particular, the side effects are produced in five percent of patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> pain and <unk> pain, but now you think -- "The five percent is not very likely to go to me, even how to take the <unk>
But a moment, a moment.
You remember that under stress don't think about it.
So think about how to do it with time, so you don't have to make the chain of thinking in the act.
300 people take the temperature -- isn't about five percent of the 300 percent of the 300 percent of the 300 people have effects.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug to help us help you.
I don't say they had or not take the <unk>
I just say to have this conversation with his doctor.
The medical ethic is that it is part of the early consent of consent to be.
We have to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe they are thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the <unk> but actually this number necessary to treat a pretty typical one.
For the surgery that else is done in the largest men of 50, <unk> of the breast cancer -- the number necessary to try is <unk>
This is, I got surgeries by a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, they produce in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you have luck and it's one of that 50 percent the effects -- just a year or two.
So the idea of the <unk> is to think before the questions that you can be able to get the conversation to go forward.
You don't have why to make all this in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because it has a lot of a lot of times, they want a more free life free of pain, or a long life that could have a lot of pain to the community.
These are the things that talk about and think about now, with his family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the time, but unless you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that it gets a lot of systems.
There is an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> to face with a button, you don't need the immune system, or the immune system, or the system, or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, and it's not <unk>
Unfortunately, one of the things that is going through the window during those moments of stress moments is the obvious thought like Danny <unk> and their colleagues have been done for.
So we have to be <unk> to think about the future to this kind of thing.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we all are <unk>
We're all going to be able to have a while.
The idea is to think about the future how you could be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help to minimize whether or to help the bad things in the first place.
<unk> at the night night, when I came back from my journey, my contractor was going back to me a combination of combination with the door, with a <unk> of the door in the same, a easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have a lot of letters that I haven't done, and lots of messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very uncomfortable but I see the organization like a <unk> process and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
CP: <unk> is my favorite musical <unk>
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more power.
Four <unk> extremely consequences.
This is my picture of a <unk> tree, there is that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be never <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> besides a little bit of my own history.
The French language language came up for the 1990s and with the time of the time, we put up with local signs and the language that we know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I taught me that the sound was not a part of my life.
And I believed it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for all.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, actually are in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a <unk> world is like if I lived in a regular country following their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my <unk> and the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create <unk> and I've seen how people came from.
So I learned for example.
"No <unk> <unk>
Don't do a lot of noise to eat the <unk> <unk>
Not <unk> and when you are <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
All of this would call it <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the <unk> label of what the average person does.
I'm <unk> <unk>
And I always am waiting for <unk> the sound, on which is going to come to next.
And there is this task.
<unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> by <unk>
You can see that the <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sound through the <unk> or <unk>
In the culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, to do this with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
It's why in my drawings I just have four lines in the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the chance to go to Berlin, Germany, Germany, for an artistic stage there.
Before this time, I had worked as <unk>
For this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and while I was from a place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that was called the trend and that was called the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has done in my territory of art.
It is going to be <unk> more of it.
I realized that it doesn't have to be like that.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know so well that you don't just experience through the <unk>
I can feel that it would be <unk> or <unk> or even as a idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my own oil.
And all I had taught me in terms of sound, I decided to leave and <unk>
I started creating a new body for work.
And when he introduced it to the artistic community, it was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I had.
I realized that the sound is like the money, the power, the <unk> <unk>
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt like the sound was <unk> it was a <unk>
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my work work or I could <unk>
I chose to be <unk>
There are a mass culture around the language.
And just because I don't use my <unk> voice to reconstruct the eyes of society is like if it wasn't a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who are going to be used to be used and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in the current society.
So in the school, in the work and institutions, work with many different <unk> different <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
We basically ask to <unk> their voices, I am able to keep a computer way of value of something like to take a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I don't keep with this practice, I feel that it could be <unk> in <unk> and not having no kind of social value.
So, with the sound like my new artistic director in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For instance, a musical note can be able to capture and express completely in the paper.
And it can be a concept in <unk>
The two are very deep and highly <unk> which means that changes changes can affect all the meaning so much of the signals as the sounds.
I'd like to share a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> is <unk> in many different ways.
If you see a different <unk> for each finger while it touches the piano, like the expression of the body, the water movement, the way of the hand and so, while it turns out the piano, the English is a <unk> language as if you get back to the piano, the English is a <unk> language as if you get <unk>
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need to have the 10 toes in order to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If you just can change the <unk> the <unk> would create a whole different thing.
Same thing about music in terms of <unk> and volume.
In <unk> to use these different parameters <unk> you can express different ideas.
So for instance, the <unk> <unk>
This is the <unk> <unk>
I'm seeing.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are you <unk>
Oh, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the lens of music?
If I had to create a sign and <unk> and again, it could get to be like a piece of visual music.
So for instance, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes into the sun comes into it.
This is <unk>
If you put it up and <unk> the speed, <unk> it looks like a musical piece of <unk>
All the day.
I feel that the same can be <unk> <unk>
All of the <unk>
This is the whole night, in this task.
And this led to me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two two things.
This represents how long in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in the time.
For instance, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands -- the one is two and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is in the back.
So, the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite idea with a very new idea and dramatic at the time, <unk> a copy.
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
But yet, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think it would automatically have <unk>
You see <unk> hand right, <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of the hand called <unk> <unk>
You can do it with me?
All of the hands at it.
Now we're going to do that so much in your head like your chest -- something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, like this, is a visual tool to help to communicate in all cultures and the languages, in all the world.
The second thing I would like to show you is this. Please do with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, <unk> please get back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar -- all in your head and the chest. But it's very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and <unk> as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And only because the <unk> doesn't have simple, automatically have no social value.
We have to start question what drives the social value and to allow them to be able to use their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to do a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that there is not going to be <unk> to learn <unk> I don't hear to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich <unk> and I would like to have the same experience.
I'd like to be able to be able to open their ears, to open the eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never knows, they can be in all of us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> I am me.
And for a child, my parents said, "Can you get to me, but then you have to be <unk>
The freedom means responsibility.
But my imagination took me all these wonderful places where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a <unk> bubble.
When I was getting bigger to me that the adults are also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean the other ones.
The time happened, now I'm a adult and teach citizens and invention in the school <unk>
You don't have to wait for a lot of my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of trash.
So as good as good citizens, <unk> the <unk> and not, it's not <unk> and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's a <unk>
And in the last decades, we have been coming out with these large oil and networks, to collect these bits of plastic to study up under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts and it's very expensive and it's very expensive, and it's also very <unk> to use those very extraordinarily <unk>
So with my students, with my students, two to 15 years ago to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Hong <unk>
We started building this <unk> work with <unk> <unk> so the young children are also <unk>
And I'm going to tell you the kids who are paying tools to be great and sure.
Don't exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We put the plastic and we cut it to the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of his <unk>
We do that.
I'll leave the imagination of my students.
My work is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to <unk> in something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collect bits of plastic, just <unk> information.
By the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> children are <unk> a lot with robots.
So we started quickly what we call <unk> <unk>
We are so fast in the creation of prototypes that we finished before lunch.
And then we transform light and cameras and <unk> and <unk> in a robot that will move slowly by water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image of the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating through the sensor while the computer computer process this image and measure the size of every <unk> to get a estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step back to a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would do even more.
The great thing in this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to control it.
I'm going to do my problem -- but my students in Hong Hong Kong are young children.
You see the news, <unk> the Internet, and it's <unk> with this <unk>
A child, maybe over 10 years ago, a oil oil is just using the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water that is <unk> the water where they live in.
You can see that water is cold and the oil and the oil are also dark color and when it all came off, it's very difficult to see what there is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what there is in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can <unk> through all kinds of things that produce different <unk> which can help identify what there's in the water.
<unk> this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to look at a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I'm doing a problem to <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a second far, and I wanted to go a bit more far, maybe we can address a more difficult, and also more close to me.
I'm half Japanese and half French and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a <unk> earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that I saw, several waves <unk> called <unk> and those <unk> and those <unk> in the coast of Japan.
More of 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the power of nuclear energy in America, a nuclear power to the water.
And today, according to the age of 300 tons are still endangered the nuclear power in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean. It has <unk> of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast of the coast of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like the most of the radiation <unk> from the Japanese coast of the British coast and the majority of time, it has a certain thing, it's blue.
Well, it's actually a bit more complicated than that.
I've gotten to <unk> every year from the accident. and a independent way with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the children.
Of course, not the <unk> parents not <unk>
But every night <unk> the <unk> <unk>
It could seem that they didn't take the work job, but they did it because they're going to have to live with <unk> all his life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talk about what we were going to do after, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the solar plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
With this we were able to notice that the central powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system, and it <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But with this we set up with a modern expedition to the lower nuclear to the date.
We're closer to 1.5 miles of the nuclear central and the help of fishermen in the area we were collecting <unk> <unk> with a <unk> of sediment as we did we invented and make it.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a <unk> problem to a global problem.
And it has been very exciting to work in these different different new technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit of the meantime, we find a industrial installation in Hong Hong <unk> and we converted it into the largest space and environmental and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Hong <unk> and it's a place where we can work with <unk> <unk> chemistry -- a little bit of biology, that basically can build almost all there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can become the help, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk>
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the population population transforming their mechanical chairs in new vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> but the worst legacy that we can leave our children are <unk>
We can't allow us to protect children of the awful truth because we need their imagination to invent solutions.
So, citizens <unk> <unk> we need to do to the next generation for the environment and people, and so I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures are radically powerful.
One is made of thousands of steel, the other one of a <unk>
One of them is synthetic <unk>
One is where you get on the environment, the other thing happened to it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
They were glad to say when he looked at the <unk> it saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was only the only tool of <unk>
But the living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smaller units of life, and cells, we took all the information that we had to work for each cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution the world of design has been dominated by <unk> and production in mass.
The lines of <unk> have shown a world done from parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think their objects like <unk> of parts of <unk> with different things.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think about human skin, for example.
Our facial constitution are <unk> with <unk>
<unk> of the hands are more <unk> with little <unk>
One acts are mainly like <unk> the other are mainly like barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that comes up their functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here is a <unk> screen that represents my view of the world -- twice the double personality of each designer and an architect to work now between the <unk> and the brain between Henry Ford and growth, between Henry Ford and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left side and the right hand, and it shows in the two places after me.
My job, in his simplest level, it is to bring these two visions of the world, coming from <unk> and the growth of growth.
Probably you know, why now?
Why did it not be possible for this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment where they have four disciplines that offers designers to tools that we never had had access to before.
And in the intersection of these four photographs, my team and I tried to do it.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We're designing objects, products, structures and tools through the top of a huge scale, like this electrical arm with a <unk> of diameter with a basis of <unk> with a basis of <unk> which will be not very busy to print buildings -- and graphics to <unk> made in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a <unk> of the old civil architecture and has created a screen where each other, is the size of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> this was for a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's like a second skin <unk> in the <unk> of a single piece, <unk> in the <unk>
Together with a 3D printing <unk> we set up this layer and warm 3D <unk> to show you more objects like that.
So this helmet combined materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> <unk>
That designers have access to this <unk> <unk> and the <unk> instruments enables to design products that are <unk> not just the way of our bodies, but also the natural structure of our own.
We also have designed a wheelchair a chair at the time <unk> comfortable and also as a sound.
The <unk> Professor my <unk> went back to the nature of <unk> and to design this pattern of surface <unk> it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties that are looking at <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the <unk> of pressure in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, which is their functionality not through the case of another material or another <unk> but <unk> and <unk> the material.
But it's nature <unk>
There is no parts in consciousness.
I didn't grew up in a Jewish home but when I was young, my grandmother was telling me stories of the Bible, <unk> and one of them became a lot of what it matters.
As she <unk> "In the third day of the <unk> God sent the Earth to grow a tree <unk> <unk>
For that first tree <unk> wouldn't have no difference between <unk> <unk> and <unk>
All the tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land actually grow trees with <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world done from place.
I often ask me, "What would it be the design if the objects were made of a single bottle.
<unk> a better state.
So let's look for the material <unk> the kind of material of the tree <unk> and we discovered it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons -- they produce each year by organisms.
We think if we can replace their <unk> we could generate <unk> structures in a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  we asked a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we have been able to achieve a wide range of <unk> from the dark, hard and <unk> to the light light, <unk>
So to print the structures at large scale, it built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material and creating these structures built from a single material for a half of a half of a <unk>
When the pieces are <unk> the leaves to find a natural form with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a <unk> process used to contain <unk> who came for the first time in the planet a billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators in Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria designed to capture quickly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into depression.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition with no problems of <unk> to <unk> and if it <unk> even more, to <unk>
A <unk> <unk> <unk>
Working with an old material one of the first life forms in the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure that is made of <unk> structure.
And here is the best <unk> for objects designed in the sea, <unk> the life <unk> and built in the ground, they will grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration of the same principles of design was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life of <unk>
So to do that, we need to master bacteria and control their <unk>
So like the periodic table we did our own <unk> <unk> new forms of life created <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology, like the green <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals are <unk> new biological <unk> within very small channels within very small.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two <unk>
The first is the <unk>
She lives in our oceans and in the water <unk>
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human species.
A turn light in sugar, the other <unk> sugar and increase a useful for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it would never be <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship to a piece of clothing.
Think about it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution for design.
So to contain these relationships, we have created a only channel that looks like by <unk> <unk> that help you think about these bacteria and to <unk> their function to work.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body -- the properties of the material to the <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> <unk>
This <unk> system <unk> when it comes from a end to another, it's 60 feet.
This is half of the length of a lawyer and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> in TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life within the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are high creatures in fashion -- only half a <unk>
What happens if design would be <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the matter <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin skin, the fabric and <unk> our <unk>
Think about this as a way to edit the biology.
I call this the material.
So for it, there's always to go to nature.
For now, you know that a 3D printer makes material <unk>
It also knows that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
And this teenager of the <unk> for instance, creates a highly <unk> architecture in which it was <unk>
The manufacturing is not about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but in two materials in different <unk>
One acts like structure, the other is the glue or the <unk> <unk> those fibers between yes.
And this happens through scales.
The mathematical worm is actually defined in the environment, creates a mechanical structure and then it starts to <unk> a <unk>
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, you have a single material.
With the end of understanding better how this process works, we put a small magnet to the head of a worm of <unk> <unk>
We put it inside a box with sensors -- and that allowed us to create this cloud cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of smallpox of <unk>
But yet, when you put the silk worm in a <unk> <unk> not inside a box, we realized that I was <unk> and I was still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that the form, the structure of the <unk> <unk> directly by the environment.
It's often <unk> worms to death inside their <unk> their silk <unk> and it uses in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we can be able to shape the <unk> silk without a <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we put this process to the visual scale.
We had a robot <unk> doing <unk> and we put it into our site.
We knew that worms are <unk> into the more dark areas and <unk> so we use a <unk> <unk> diagram.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the light in the light and heat, put the silk worms on the structure.
We were prepared to get <unk>
We have <unk> worms with a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks ago, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put it carefully on the lower edge of the <unk> and while <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short one.
<unk> Diego said that the tension is the great integrity, and I was right.
At the <unk> genetic silk about the silk <unk> <unk> give all this <unk>
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks -- <unk> worms of <unk> <unk>
And in a <unk> issue, this is also the length of the <unk>
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
One <unk> silk through a <unk> arm, the other full piece of flying.
If the last test of design is to give life to products and the buildings around us, to form a factor of two materials, designers have to bring these two visions of the world.
What brings us from around, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of the creation, that brings us from a design inspired in nature to an nature inspired by design, which requires us, for the first time, that we do with nature.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever asked you what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked the first time this?
You can <unk> with the fingers.
Three. <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now, raise your hand if the question do you want to be <unk>
It has been caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I am somebody who could never answer the question what do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In the school, I liked the English, the <unk> and the art, and the art and developed places in a <unk> <unk> called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general I like to test and <unk> anyway, because of having a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is not a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to go in.
But then I would tell me for another thing, something completely different, and I would get to me in it, and I'm going to leave me and I feel <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to turn up.
But then I'd like to figure out something new and different, and I would like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of <unk> for two reasons.
The first was because it wasn't sure how I was going to convert all this in a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, they chose all my other <unk> and <unk> to <unk>
The other reason that he caused to me so many anxiety was a little <unk>
I worried that there was something bad in this, and something bad in me for all.
I worried to be afraid of <unk> or to be <unk> or to be <unk> or my own success.
If you can be my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you to ask something I would like to do that I would have been done on.
<unk> themselves, where learned to assign the meaning of bad or urbanization to do things.
I'm going to tell you where the <unk> was learned about the culture.
You know, you know what you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody does matters what it was <unk>
It's considered a <unk> issue to make answers to be beautiful in children like, <unk> or <unk> <unk> or I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question comes up and again as we put in various ways -- <unk> students to graduate students have to choose to choose in university.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the beautiful exercise before we take it on the dream.
Why?
If this issue is inspired by kids to dream with what you might be, is not inspired to dream with everything that could be.
In fact, it makes it right right now, because when someone ask you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things -- even though adults are going to be <unk> and say, "Oh, what good -- but you can't be <unk> but you can't be <unk> but you can't be <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he is <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> a teacher and <unk>
But most of the kids don't have to talk about people like this.
All you hear is that they are going to have to kill them.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of the destiny or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to go for time in this land, and you have to figure out what is that thing and dedicate their life to it.
But and if you're somebody that's not connected to this way?
What happens if there are many different themes that you hear their curiosity and many different things that wants to do?
There is no place for somebody like you in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling there is something bad with you.
There's nothing bad in you.
It's a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interests.
It's a <unk> for it.
It could be able to be able to be able to go up in three ways, we have potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms of the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
For the time, the ideal was who was good <unk> in multiple numbers.
Seven <unk> comes to us like <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It looks like a kind of moving to a community, we can't be according to a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as a limitation or <unk> that you have to start?
But what I've learned talking to people and writing about these ideas in my website, is that there's huge strengths to be in this way.
Here is three <unk>
First, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their interests shared interests of data, and mathematics and design, to <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel it came up with this idea only for its <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
The innovation is happening in the schools?
So that's the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their <unk> can access to a huge amount of these points of <unk>
The second <unk> <unk> is learning learning.
When the <unk> are interested with something, we're going to it.
We see everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to test new things and come out of our areas of color.
A lot of skills are <unk> and we carry everything that we've learned to each new area that <unk> so we seldom started from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> time and a <unk>
As a <unk> <unk> an amazing capacity to develop traditional memory.
Now, she's the <unk> <unk>
Before become a <unk> <unk> was <unk>
He had to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to learn the <unk> and this ability to write, to write a lot of a lot of a lot of
<unk> is a loss of time to go back to what you want to do, even if at the end of the <unk>
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field of a way you could not have <unk>
The third <unk> <unk> is <unk> I mean, the ability to turn into any thing that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, different designer designer designer -- sometimes <unk> and sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
The journal magazine <unk> <unk> like the most important ability for development, to engage in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations who can <unk> the needs of the market, which really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could lose if they have been done to reduce their goals.
As society, we have a great interest to encourage the <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems -- <unk> right now, and we need creative creative to do in front of them.
Let's say they're in his heart, <unk>
<unk> from <unk> knowing because they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing bad in you.
In fact, some of the best teams you get from a doctor and a <unk> <unk>
The doctor can focus in depth and put in practice ideas, and the <unk> offers a <unk> of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we all should design lives and careers that <unk> the way we're connected.
And, unfortunately the <unk> in a huge part of us to be able to be <unk> to be more like their <unk>
Once you say this, if there is one thing that you can take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the <unk> <unk> is what it is.
If you can be a heart, then we put through all the media.
That's where you can give the best of yes.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those that you just have to realize to be one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with their own passions.
Take their curiosity for those <unk>
<unk>
<unk> our <unk> takes us to a more real life and happy.
And perhaps the most important thing we do is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman called <unk> led to a <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until that, unfortunately, they died in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of a guy who never had before.
The most amazing thing.
If you have been alive today, we could not be living today, we could not give him the more aid that you would <unk> he gave them <unk> years.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> patients.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in getting a diagnosis that we now call the disease disease.
From <unk> medicine has a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for cancer, fighting for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and so much more.
But it was just done in the treatment of Alzheimer's
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's since a decade ago.
So I think about this all the time.
Education now affects 40 million around the world.
But in 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include a lot of you.
If you expect to live to 85 years or more, the possibility of provide Alzheimer's to be almost one of each of each of them.
In other words, there is the probability that you do their years <unk> with Alzheimer's or helping me take care of a friend or to be wanted to Alzheimer's
Because only in the United States, oil care costs 200 billion each year.
One of five dollars of the healthcare is spend in the disease disease.
This is the most expensive disease and their costs <unk> a increase of five times in the year as 2050, as the generation of <unk>
It can surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the largest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively <unk>
Today, one of the 10 early causes of all the world, Alzheimer's is the only thing that you can't be able to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we have fewer time and money in the research of the same.
The U.S. government spend 10 times more every year in the research research that in Alzheimer's -- despite the fact that we get more than Alzheimer's and causes a number of <unk> as cancer.
The lack of resources is because of a more fundamental causes of consciousness.
Because this is what time people knows, but all the world <unk> depression is a disease, and we can <unk>
For the largest part of the last <unk> years, all of the scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think to be <unk> in a normal part and inevitable <unk>
But only there is a picture of a healthy brain -- so with a healthy patient to see the physical physical damage for this disease.
In addition to a <unk> loss of memory and skills to experience the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's increasing life expectancy and it's always important.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We know that they're made of molecules of protein.
You can think of a protein that's like a piece of paper that is <unk> as a reality?
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it was <unk> well, these <unk> points end on the inside.
But sometimes the things get wrong, and some of them are going on the outside.
So this makes the molecules of the protein <unk> each other who can form large motion and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's
We've spent the last 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of <unk> and what we step forward is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do anything.
<unk> the other can do that the pump <unk>
You have to find the right step that it would do, and then to create a drug that do it.
Up until recently, in their greatest part of the wires and expected the best.
But now there's a big group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> <unk> engineers and A-rhythm-etic.
And together, we have been able to identify a critical step in the process -- right now is looking at a new kind of drugs that are doing specifically to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last outcomes.
No one outside our lab has seen it.
Let's take a few videos of what happened to test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move with normal.
These loves over the other hand, have molecules of the protein that you fall on each of them, like in humans with Alzheimer's
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms in a early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive result -- but the research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and versa.
After <unk> years, there are real hope that it can be done in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so that it enhances that hope, of <unk> Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have <unk> than Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we do it <unk> we can <unk>
In the case of other disease, patients and their families and their families have gotten more research and <unk> pressure on governments, industry and <unk>
That was essential to move up in the treatment of the <unk>
We see that same unit to sell cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the European victims of their loved day, day and night, they're often too much <unk> to go out and choose for change.
So it really depends on you.
Education is not in most cases a genetic illness.
All the world with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there's 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that you need to own.
<unk> speaking for them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article in the New York column of the New York Times, in January of this year.
You know, to look at some of them to do this.
The article is about a modern study designed to create romantic romantic love in the laboratory, and my own experience to that I was able to be able to be able to be at the last night of the summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers are <unk> to get to 36 questions more and more personal questions and then both you look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions here here.
Number <unk> If you could increase tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would it be?
Number <unk> When was the last time that you would go to another person <unk>
And <unk>
And so they were <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> <unk> to your couple of a couple what you like to do, or I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say somebody you've ever seen.
When I woke up with this study a few years ago, a detail really called me to me, the crowd of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process to make romantic love, but from course it was <unk>
And when I had the attempt to test this study with somebody who knew I was not particularly very well, I didn't expect <unk>
But yet, we have <unk> and  and I thought it was a good story, so I would send it to the <unk> public column a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you are probably going to get together with me.
And the reason I think that you know, this is because you have done this question and again in the last seven months.
And this question is what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
One week before you put the article was very nervous.
He had been working in a romantic book in the last years, so I had <unk> to write about my experience in love love in my blog.
But a blog is able to get a few hundreds of <unk> like a lot, and those were usually just my friends of Facebook and imagined that my article in the New York Times <unk> probably a few of thousands of events.
And that was a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as it was <unk> I had no idea.
The article ran in a line on the night, and then I put it down in the bottom of my blog.
And luckily, I had been called the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million town, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster the confidence writing with me, on own own experience, but another thing is to discover that the <unk> life of one has been international news -- and that people all are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or <unk> what they did every day for weeks -- always, they did first question the same question: They still follow it.
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search at the <unk> of my email with the <unk> <unk> still <unk>
And so many messages came up in a little bit.
They were from students and journalists and strangers <unk> like this.
I was running on the radio, and it <unk>
Even I took a talk, and a woman looked at the stage, "My <unk> where your <unk>
And I immediately became a red one.
I think this is part of the thing.
If you write about your relationship in a international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable wondering about it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times ran a <unk> article for St. <unk> which was the experience of the readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first struggle to all this attention was to be very excited with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we're both doing a public emergence together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I think I was afraid of being afraid of being being afraid of <unk> <unk> of the process of <unk> a range for which I didn't feel about the <unk>
And I understand that people don't want to know just if the study worked worked -- they wanted to know if you really be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to produce <unk> but love, love <unk>
But this was a question that I wasn't able to tell me.
My relationship had just a few months ago, and I felt, about all, that people gave the wrong question.
How do we go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, do the experience of doing these 36 questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study, and there is the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I used to foster <unk> <unk> among students who would use what it would <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds <unk> right?
But the study itself worked.
The participants had felt more close to doing that, several African studies also used to <unk> <unk> <unk> like a quick way to create confidence and interaction between strangers.
They have been used between the police and the community. And they have been used between people of political policy.
The original version of the story, which I gave the summer of the last summer, which we looked at my personal questions with four little minutes of visual contact, was cited in this case, but unfortunately never <unk>
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a small university school, and then a student came back to me and said to me and he said to <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "Do you want to say that you are <unk> of the person with <unk>
Well, he did a program.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but it became better <unk>
<unk> I did have even better to test the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think that is the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I woke up with the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a <unk>
There was that relationship since I had 20, which I was supposed to have 20, which was supposed to have a lot of my own life, and he was my first real love, and I didn't have to live without it.
So I was in science.
And so it was all that I could find on the science science of love, and I hoped that that could be kind of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I was just talking to the book I was writing but in retrospect, it looks really <unk>
I thought that if I was <unk> with the knowledge of love love, I would never have to feel as bad and used to me.
And all this knowledge has been useful from one or another way.
I am more patient with love with love.
I have more confidence to demand what I think.
But I can also see it more -- and I can realize that what I am looking for is sometimes more than well as well as they would be reasonably to me.
What I'm looking at love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but that I will keep being <unk> based on the person who I love.
It can be that this is the fact that people wondered when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media said about 36 questions is that it can have a <unk>
It can have a way to be a way to be a certain way of risk <unk> and this is a very <unk> story because they look at us to feel <unk> but it's also <unk>
But I think when it is about love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story that question: They still follow it together?
And his content with a answer of <unk> or No.
So more than a question, <unk> that we do questions more difficult, questions like, how to decide who who deserves your love and who not?
How do you stay in work, when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the religion that inevitably is that you can see a pen, or even more, how do you live with the question of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a <unk> conversation about what means to love anybody.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, is <unk> a year -- a year and I apply a study designed to create romantic love, we still keep us together, and I'm very <unk>
But they are not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy.
So at the end of my article <unk> love was not happened.
<unk> <unk> because we took the choice to be.
And I kind of <unk> a little bit to read now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I had no thought that it was supposed to be.
It didn't have a few times we would have both to take that decision, and how sometimes we have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want to be enough to be done, and he responded to the questions, I would have chosen to love somebody so <unk> so and so much and to have made that choice in the largest largest day.
But what I've done, instead, is to convert my relationship in the kind of myth that I don't think of truth.
And what you do, and what maybe spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the end of a happy <unk> in the title of my memory, which is going to true, the only part of the article that actually didn't know.
But what I have in change is the chance to choose to be able to have someone, and the hope that he also loves me, and it's <unk> but that's the attempt with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a few <unk> and in a certain way I came as a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York makes a time --  -- something that really understood me but more else else on.
I'll start with a eight years.
He took a box of wood, and <unk> a pound of a dollar, a <unk> and a detector in there in some place.
And I thought a few of strangers or a few of them would find this box about 500 years ago and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas -- for example, how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
In all ways, it has <unk> because here I am, 30 years later and I'm still doing <unk>
At a moment because he was in <unk> <unk> like to go back and do and do and all those things <unk> and I was doing a <unk> for my mother.
And I took a dictionary, and I looked at all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother has fear of bees and it is <unk> to them, so I put more <unk> in the '50s, thinking that I could <unk>
Instead, it happened to the same, somehow it seemed to increase from size, as if it was that it was going to be <unk> the text with a <unk>
So I said, I built more boxes.
So this time, I started to add elements around the weird things that I was finding by the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that my God, I can draw in space.
I can be able to be able to look at the same thing about a <unk> in the scene of the crime.
And I took the objects and created my own <unk> <unk>
First, <unk> that you can be able to get a idea.
Then I did a few insects and creatures.
It was very excited to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started to start <unk> and those things, and I was doing something of money, to take my girlfriend to dinner, for instance, to go to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some time I was interested interested in the human way, sculptures of the size of the natural size of human beings.
It was great, except for one thing:
I didn't know what to do, because the <unk> was going to kill me.
And I was going to the bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use <unk>
I started drawing in the layers of glass, similar to the drawing in a window, then in another window, and another window, and it had all of these windows together, and I had all of these windows together that will put a three-dimensional show.
And this really worked and so I could leave the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very large that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I inspired me in a huge measure in "The garden of <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit like your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
Two meters long.
It has double face, so they are 10 meters old.
It's a little weird.
Well, that's the source of the blood.
On the left, is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals are fighting between two worlds.
They are in the world of <unk> to this <unk> <unk> where you get <unk>
Here is where the creatures with animals are running to the <unk> <unk> for <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is made of thousands of elements.
This is a <unk> god <unk> a <unk>
Billy Graham Graham is in the <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the shelter of <unk> <unk> there are all kinds of rare things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
We also also have a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it keeps oil in a hand while the other hand comes to you.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand in which it <unk>
And then when you go back to the other side, it has a <unk> like a <unk> and it makes it <unk> of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail, a long tail, which kills the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turned to the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why I did that.
Things else you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They were done in the 1990s as if they were <unk> cards of the terrorists.
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's about a six years to do 100 of these human beings.
Every one is a picture of our culture, through media and material or material or <unk>
But each one acts like a kind of archive in a form of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they are together, they are <unk>
And you can walk on each of them, and you get a few years.
Every single one is basically a microscope of microscope that weighs <unk> pounds with a human trapped in their inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That is the <unk> is the chest <unk>
I'm going to engage for the rest of the body -- there is a magnet that comes out of your chest and that you take the <unk> or <unk> or what is that you have a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick <unk> of these works because I can't <unk> for a long time.
We have channels you can see.
This is a game for half.
This is two and it's communicating between the two two things.
There are a few bits that come and come into the head of this strange feeling.
There's a small scene inside the <unk> <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> box called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a writer, a writer, a writer, a <unk> a <unk> a school, a school, a Japanese arm, which surrounds all the content we do in the world; and a garden.
<unk> the box and all of the people around inside the other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you get <unk> who is and the box is that it is.
And together we came together to realize that we all are together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of religion doesn't work.
We're all very done in the same matter and in the same box.
And if we didn't start to exchange those things with mathematics and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you want to look at your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first about the gut, the <unk> and other organs.
I'll take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug <unk> effect in the body.
<unk> though, is that at <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially with HIV.
When you take drugs <unk> these form to lower the amount of virus in the blood, and increase the <unk> of cells.
But they are also known by their favorite effects effects in their negative majority -- because in the time that we have to get up to the current <unk> and worse even for time that you take on their destiny, which is where most importantly, in the intelligence of HIV.
These are regions of the body as the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't really easily be easily in the ultimate blood of the patients who are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> by intellectual drugs.
However, after the treatment of treatment, the virus can be <unk> and to do new cells <unk>
This is the great problem of treatment of HIV with the current drugs that is a treatment of life that is <unk>
One day, I felt and I thought, <unk> to get treatment directly to the <unk> of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of <unk> <unk>
If you use it in <unk> for <unk> and surgery of the diabetes, they can be used for any other <unk> including transportation of drugs.
In fact, we're already using <unk> <unk> to open or <unk> with extremely small holes that open and <unk> almost immediately the cells living with HIV to bring the drugs.
The best you ask, "How is that <unk>
We put a little bit powerful and powerful ray of the <unk> cell structures for HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid <unk>
The laser across the cell -- while the cell uses the drug in a matter of information.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk>
We are currently testing this technology in <unk> or the goal of <unk> but the goal is to take this technology to the human body -- that the human body.
So what is that <unk> can be done.
Well, the answer is through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we will do a <unk> in the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it comes to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head of a <unk> which goes up the car, it releases it directly in the site of infection, while the laser uses again to keep the open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you have success, this technology can lead to the international eradication of HIV in the body.
Yes. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researcher in our case, a treatment with <unk>
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studied groups of <unk> organizations like terrorists, <unk> or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand to these <unk> agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition of financial participation to sustainability.
I make work work in the world of policy and the library.
I'll learn these groups is key to solve almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
I used to be a <unk> between states.
No not.
Now it's a conflict between the states and actors, no sharks.
For instance, for example, of the <unk> <unk> of peace -- and 2011, <unk> had been between a state and an actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we even have <unk> or <unk> in any level of resolution of sustainable policy.
But how do you do that?
We have to know what brings these organizations.
We know very good for the reasons why they do it, but nobody looks like when I didn't get <unk>
<unk> struggle and policies are not <unk>
Everything is part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, no less <unk> without a global vision.
The business groups are private organizations.
For instance, the <unk> <unk> was known by his <unk> <unk>
From his creation in the 1990s <unk> it also has established a political party a network of social services and a military device.
At the same way, the Palestinian <unk> known by their tax attacks in Israel, also also delivered the <unk> of Bangladesh from 2007.
So these groups make more that these groups are doing more than just fire.
They're <unk>
<unk> a complex machinery of <unk> stations in TV channels of TV, places of the Internet and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
The business groups are also investing in a complex <unk> <unk> but through business businesses for example, development development.
These activities are true.
They allow these groups increase their strength, increase their <unk> to recruit better and building their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else, create more strong <unk> with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they get hospitals, they put up into the mechanical programs programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The business groups are also trying to assume the population makes something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan in the war or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can be able to be able to see the efforts of these groups.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price increase for the population.
But in general, provide social services it means to fill a vacuum, a <unk> gap for government, and it enables these groups and increase their power.
For instance, the <unk> victory of 2006, Palestinian <unk> cannot be able to recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because we're able to be <unk> by the government, and they spread as a private groups and politics, they are involved in the violent struggle and give up.
And the more complex and sophisticated are these organizations, less to <unk> as something opposite to a state.
How do I call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, they put up all their <unk> <unk> you get the <unk> system.
It's a <unk> It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state, and the hardest as the Middle East, and the Middle East.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in computer tools.
<unk> that DNA comes to be in the center of any sustainable.
This is very important to establish and reconstruct peace.
If we understand the <unk> groups -- we will understand how to provide the transition to encourage the transition of violence to violence.
In this new <unk> between states and actors, the military power can earn a few of them, but we don't give us peace for us.
So to achieve these goals we need to engage a long way to fill out the security vacuum to fill out that DNA <unk> that allowed these groups to come into a beginning.
Thank you.
I am a failure like a woman and as a <unk>
My views about gender gender gender is <unk> but I'm afraid to accept <unk> the label of <unk> would be <unk>
I'm <unk> but pretty bad.
And so much as a bad <unk>
Or at least, I wrote a <unk> and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in birth, people started to call <unk> <unk>
So, what started as a personal joke was meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become something bigger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my days and 20 years, I had strange ideas on the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and that <unk> the sex.
Today, I see how the women are the women in all the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a beautiful answer.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people in the <unk> which could be <unk>
It will be <unk> like feminist was a <unk> a word and nasty.
I was <unk> like a woman who doesn't follow the rules, that asked too much to the rules, and I'm going to believe that it's equal or left to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine to be another person.
With time, as I was growing better, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also, proud to be.
For me, certain people are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same chance for the same work.
We have right to travel for the world like <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have right to use a easy way and accessible the cost, and the services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need to be <unk> or <unk>
We have the right to <unk>
There are more.
When you talk about the needs of women, we have to realize our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different brain expression of gender -- religion and schools, social condition and a lot more.
We have to think of these differences and how we do it care about the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> ours is not nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear. I'm a disaster.
I'm filled with <unk>
There are a lot of things that do a bad <unk>
I have another <unk>
When I go to work, I hear music rap <unk> to all volume.
Even though the letter responds to the women and <unk> and this is the classic <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality with your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> until you give you the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry isn't it?
I'm completely <unk> for my musical <unk>
I firmly believe in the work of the man, which is all that I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the tasks <unk> but also kill insects, the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The curve is my favorite color.
<unk> of the fashion magazines and of the simple things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Some of my <unk> are more <unk>
If a woman wants to take the name of his husband, is their choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay on home to raise their children, they don't know that choice, too.
The problem is not that it comes to more vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> in ways that women are connected to be economically vulnerable when they <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional Rio, that has ignored or <unk> because the needs of the women of color, the <unk> and <unk> to favor of Muslim women, <unk> <unk>
Let's say, if that's a very bad feminist
It's also going to happen to the following: <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we would be <unk>
When we <unk> the <unk> with a lot for the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think about that <unk> before you try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of <unk> have afraid of being destroyed as <unk>
They have afraid to put up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> by fear to what it means that it would not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
Take an example to <unk> or like I call it <unk>
In the last years, it's a feminist <unk>
In the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show you see this star of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud.
<unk> the time, modern innovation started <unk> if you <unk> it was or not exactly a <unk>
<unk> their <unk> instead of simply believe the word of a adult woman and <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot.
We're a lot beyond critical approaches and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman -- <unk> until it's not anything.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> -- or more well, a more <unk> is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give it to the action and be a bit more <unk>
If I hear music -- I'm creating a demand for artists who would be more than happy providing a <unk>
These artists are not going to change their way to talk about women in their songs until the change is affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does your music that will be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a better choice.
But when the bad decisions is done that makes it more difficult for women to achieve the equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think in my <unk> <unk>
These are two <unk> <unk> <unk> and I also want to grow in a world.
And where they were done by the strong creatures that they are.
I think about them, suddenly the best choice <unk> as something much more easy to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is to the sex violence against women like sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the <unk> <unk> when we hear the women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to film in another part when movies don't treat women more than <unk>
We can stop to support the professional sports where the athletes treat their colleagues like <unk>
In any case, men, especially the white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish his magazine, participate in his project, or to work with you, until you didn't have a number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or his organization is more <unk> with a more wide range of people.
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects we can also be able to be able to be even more like us, until more as we were <unk> to overcome the barriers to the <unk>
Because we are not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, and our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and waiting for our decisions to the <unk> to the people in the power of arts and music, and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can take huge decisions to create a safe change and significant.
We can also tell you with our <unk> well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad <unk>
This is truth because of a lot of reasons, but I say about all, because it would be <unk> my voice was <unk> and cinema helped me <unk>
There was a incident.
I call it an incident to do in front of what happened.
A couple of kids would be <unk> when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They tried me as if it was anything.
I started to believe that it wasn't anything.
<unk> my voice, and after all I didn't get to me to believe that I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I would be <unk> in a stronger version of myself.
So the words of those women who could understand a story like me, and the women who looked like to me and they understood what meant to live in this world if you have the skin <unk>
So the words of the women who showed me that it wasn't anything.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the Indus script and the <unk> I also discovered that if it was a little honest, another woman could hear and see that none of us is the thing that the world is about telling us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything else.
And in the other, I wake out the fact that I'm just a woman.
I am a bad <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human me.
I hope we all can do the same.
I hope we all could be a little bit -- when you need a <unk>
Right after February of the last year -- <unk> children in California had <unk> to be <unk> or by being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> to more than 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> which can be a bad for a kid with a <unk> system, which is one of the most easily diseases in the world.
There is a effective vaccine against this since over the average century, but many of the kids involved in the outbreak -- <unk> had not been <unk> because their parents had fear of something supposed to be <unk>
But one point, it was not the article that gained the concern about autism and vaccines <unk> and <unk> by being an fraud <unk> by the British Medical Medical
They don't think most smart scientists that the vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you knows, but millions of parents around the world remain <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their kids to have autism.
Why?
So here's why this is here.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism in the time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and those who had heard about it to talk about it to develop their whole professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, the estimates of prevalence are going to be just just three or four children for every 10 dollars.
But then, in the decade of 1990, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like a epidemic -- as if I could <unk> from another kid in <unk>
What is going on?
If they're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people from the Kennedy Center in order to know what is happening, they tend to be based in phrases like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to explain these numbers <unk>
But that kind of language is not <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother that comes on in the face of his son of two years, visual pain.
If the <unk> <unk> they had to be <unk> why they were so <unk>
Why were cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow progress and <unk> of science that with the power of <unk>
For the most of the 20th century, doctors said a story about what autism is autism and the way it turned out, but that story was going to be true, and the consequences of the same are having a serious impact in global health health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinic.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> ran a article that looked at 11 young patients who seemed <unk> <unk> <unk> to the people of their around, even their own parents.
You could have a sense for hours to put the hands on their faces, but they were <unk> by <unk> as when I didn't put his favorite toy in its favorite place in its real place without knowing them.
On the bottom of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very strange.
For the decade of 1950, as a main authority of the world in the subject, declared that there had seen less than 150 true cases of their presence -- while it was <unk> <unk>
This is actually not <unk> because the <unk> <unk> for autism diagnosis was very <unk>
So for instance, <unk> to give that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that this is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had become nine of every 10 children to sent for other doctors to their office to be <unk> without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of their theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by parents and <unk>
These kids, said, they have been treated in a <unk> which is not <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that we're doing in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the children in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before to get two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite inventions -- he says, "You know, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills -- <unk> things like the kids were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents <unk> to be able to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became a source source for families, and two generations of children were sent to institutions for their own good, it gets invisible to the world in general.
<unk> was not until the 1990s that researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk> cognitive <unk> thought the theory of the <unk> mothers of <unk> was pretty <unk>
She and his husband and his husband was John <unk> and they had a deep child called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard that I was to raise a girl like black-eyed services, no education services and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
So to defend the National <unk> of America that they needed more resources for kids and their families, and their families, <unk> <unk> decided to do something that should have been done 30 years before.
They did a <unk> study in the general.
<unk> a picture of London called <unk> to try to find kids in the community.
What you saw was clear that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and a lot of <unk>
Some kids could not talk to all, while others were <unk> in their reflection in the <unk> or in the <unk> of the <unk>
The other way, these kids didn't fit in <unk> <unk> and <unk> like <unk> and they saw a lot of them, so much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have possible.
At the beginning, they were lost by trying to give sense to their data.
How nobody had no <unk> of these kids before?
But then I did -- I found a reference to a article published in <unk> last year to the article of <unk> and then then it was <unk> in the <unk> of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article from the competition, but I would recreate <unk> in their own work.
There was no even even one translation to the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> he was talking to <unk> and he <unk> for it.
The document offers a alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> that I woke up an active clinic with a <unk> school in the decade of the <unk>
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for the <unk>
The morning in his clinic started with music, and the kids took their games.
Instead of <unk> the parents in causing the described as disability <unk> of life that have to have <unk> forms of support and spaces.
Instead of trying to treat kids in their clinic as patients called the <unk> his little teachers, and he took to help us in the development of education to be particularly good for them.
<unk> saw autism as a standard of the area that would take an amazing variety of <unk> and 2006.
He believed that autism and these are <unk> they were common and always have been able to see aspects of this area in <unk> known in the physical social scientist, and the <unk> <unk>
He was more there even until I mean, for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and <unk> discovered that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> so as the parents were <unk>
In the next years, worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the <unk> of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what called <unk> <unk>
At the end of the '80s and principles of the '90s, their changes in <unk> -- the <unk> model of <unk> by a wide and <unk>
These changes didn't fall on the <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and <unk> worked between <unk> these <unk> people around the world see an adult secret for the first time.
Before you come up with <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, -- <unk> by experts knew what was autism, but after the <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and parents all knew what was autism.
At the same time, they introduced the first clinical tests to use to diagnose autism.
I couldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in <unk> and the introduction of these tests created a effect of network, a perfect storm of autism.
The number of bird started <unk> as we were able to predict <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that the people with autism and their families eventually <unk> the support and the services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to the vaccines for the increase in the <unk> -- a simple simple story -- and the <unk> of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the estimate of the consumer center that one of the children in the United States are in the United States are in the United States, are one of the most big groups in the world.
In the last years, the <unk> people have been together on the Internet to be able to get the idea of the idea that are the puzzles to solve by the new doctors, the <unk> term to celebrate the varieties of human nature.
One way to understand the <unk> is to think about terms of human systems.
The fact that a computer doesn't work with <unk> doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> <unk> human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it's a <unk> of attention to the details.
The people are <unk> they have hard to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we are still going to be able to be able to be able to think that the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, are in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman called <unk> <unk> said a while, we need all the hands in covered to <unk> the ship <unk>
When we put it into a real future. We need all the forms of human intelligence forms in the planet to do in front of the challenges that we face as society.
We can't allow us to save a brain.
Thank you.
